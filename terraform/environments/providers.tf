# As of 2020-09-29, there is an open issue regarding dynamic providers (hashicorp/terraform#24476).
# Therefore, we need to generate a file that defines providers as "static" blocks.
#
# This generates a file for additional providers, based on accounts created through the "environments" module
# in environments.tf.
#
# It should not be committed as it holds account IDs.
