      placeholder: |
        Pre-checks:
        1) Confirm PagerDuty on-call coverage
        2) Validate AWS Change Calendar for freeze windows
        3) Check current ECS task health via `aws ecs describe-services`
        4) Review Terraform plan output: `terraform plan -out=plan.tfplan`

        Deploy:
        5) Apply Terraform changes: `terraform apply plan.tfplan`
          - Includes ALB listener updates, ECS task definition changes, and security group modifications
        6) Trigger GitHub Actions workflow for smoke tests: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
        7) Canary rollout:
          - Update ECS desired count to 1 task in one AZ
          - Monitor CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, 5xx errors) for 10 mins
        8) Gradual scale-up:
          - 25% → 50% → 100% traffic with 10-min soak per step

        Post-checks:
        9) Validate ALB target health: `aws elbv2 describe-target-health`
        10) Check CloudWatch dashboards for latency and error rates
        11) Confirm RDS connections stable via Performance Insights

        Testing:
        - GitHub Actions smoke test job: link to workflow run
        - Synthetic checks via Route 53 Health Checks

        - Revert the original PR in GitHub:
          1) Open the merged PR in GitHub
          2) Click **Revert** to create a new PR with the rollback commit
          3) Merge the revert PR to `main` (or the deployment branch)
        - This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to apply the previous Terraform state
        - Validate rollback completion:
          - Confirm GitHub Actions job succeeded
          - Check Terraform state matches previous version
          - Verify AWS resources reverted (ECS tasks, ALB rules, etc.)
        - Estimated rollback time: 10–15 minutes (including pipeline run)
