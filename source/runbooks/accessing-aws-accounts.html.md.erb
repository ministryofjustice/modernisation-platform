## How we access AWS accounts

We have two common methods for accessing AWS accounts:

- Through a [Single Sign-On portal](https://moj.awsapps.com/start#/).
- Through a [superuser account](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/runbooks/adding-a-new-team-member.html#adding-them-as-a-superadmin-in-our-aws-landing-zone).

### Single Sign-On access

Using a web browser, an authenticated user can navigate to the [SSO landing page](https://moj.awsapps.com/start#/) and select
an AWS account. The portal will allow them to log in to the AWS console with the relevant privileges, or to retrieve an
access key and secret key for programmatic access.

### Superuser account access

_NB. Superuser access is maintained for emergencies. In most use cases SSO access is preferred._

Using a web browser, a user with a superuser account can navigate to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.con) and
log into the Modernisation Platform with their *firstname.lastname-superadmin* account. From here the user can assume an
IAM role to escalate their privileges by clicking the *username @ account-id* dropdown and selecting *Switch Role*.

## How we use AWS accounts

We make use of our AWS accounts through web browsers, command line tools, and with CI automation. For command line access
we prefer to use the tool [AWS Vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) for the secure storage of credentials and
automatic role assumption.

## How privileged AWS roles are created

The relevant configuration for superuser accounts is defined in code [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-iam-superadmins)
and also [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/modernisation-platform-account/iam.tf).

In brief, a new user would be added to the [modernisation-platform-terraform-iam-superadmins](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-iam-superadmins)
project and a new tag would be created. Following this the [modernisation-platform-account/iam.tf](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/modernisation-platform-account/iam.tf)
would be updated to reference this new tag.

The relevant configuration for application accounts is also defined in code with a common module [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/bootstrap/delegate-access/iam.tf#L11)

This code defines a cross-account access role that can be assumed by an administrator. It is applied as part of a common
baseline for application accounts.

## Using aws-vault with terraform againt member accounts or sprinkler/cooker

aws-vault can be used to aws-sso to provide a reliable means to authenticate against aws accounts so as to run terraform commands. To install aws-vault, refer to the user-guide - https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault

The following below provides an example for running a terraform plan against sprinkler:

- Create a profile for the account in your ./aws/config file. For example for the sprinkler account:

```
[profile sprinkler]
sso_start_url = https://moj.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = eu-west-2
sso_account_id = 348456244381
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess 
region = eu-west-2
output = text
```

- Login to aws via sso using the above profile:

```
aws-vault login sprinkler
```

*Note - the --debug command can be used for trouble-shooting.*

- cd to the sprinkler directory in the local git folder for modernisation-platform-accounts and run terraform init using aws-vault:

```
aws-vault exec sprinkler -- terraform init -backend-config=assume_role={role_arn=\"arn:aws:iam::946070829339:role/modernisation-account-terraform-state-member-access\"}
```

Whilst the session is active, terraform commands can then be used without further need for aws-vault. When the session times out, re-run the aws-vault login command as above.
