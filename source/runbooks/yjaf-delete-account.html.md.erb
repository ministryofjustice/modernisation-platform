# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This process covers the removal of IAM accounts for the YJAF AWS account.

The existing pipelines are not able to delete accounts so there are some manual steps before you update and apply the terraform code.

## Manual steps to delete IAM Account

1. Access the **Youth Justice Framework Management AWS account** via [SSO](https://moj.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts).

2. Go to the IAM Console.

3. Click on `Users` tab.

4. Click on the user name you will be deleting.

5. Click on the `Security Credentials` tab

6. Go to the `Multi-factor authentication (MFA)` section. Select all devices and click on the `Remove` button.

7. Then click on the `Delete` button in the top right corner of the UI. You'll need to confirm deletion on the next screen and save changes. The user IAM account will now be deleted.

## Update [yjaf-infra-aws-mgmt](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/yjaf-infra-aws-mgmt) and apply terraform

There are two files to update:

- Remove the user name for the relevant lists in the [yjaf-mgmt-users.tfvars](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/yjaf-infra-aws-mgmt/blob/main/env_configs/yjaf-mgmt-users.tfvars) file.

- Remove the user module block from the [user.tf](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/yjaf-infra-aws-mgmt/blob/main/user-groups/users.tf) file.

Raise a PR for changes to be reviewed by the Team. Merge changes to run automated pipelines.

Done.
