# <%= current_page.data.title %>

These are the steps that we need to follow to remove access for a team member:

1. Remove them from the team page [source/team/team.html.md.erb](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/source/team/team.html.md.erb)
1. Remove them from our GitHub team [terraform/github/locals.tf](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/github/locals.tf)
1. Remove them as a superadmin to our AWS landing zone [superadmins/main.tf](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-iam-superadmins/blob/main/main.tf#L5)
1. Run the modernisation-platform account Terraform for the above code change locally as a superuser (the CI user does not have permissions to delete users)
1. Remove them from the Modernisation Platform Google Group and Slack teams.
1. Remove them from pagerduty [terraform/pagerduty/locals.tf](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/pagerduty/locals.tf)
1. Remove them from azure-aws-sso-modernisation-platform EntraID group [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

**Important: Managers will need to complete a leavers form. More information can be found [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/hr/end-change-of-employment/).**
