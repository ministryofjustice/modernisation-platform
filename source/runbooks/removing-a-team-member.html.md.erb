Along with the standard [leavers form](https://leavers.form.service.justice.gov.uk/), there are a few things to do when a team member leaves to remove their access:

1. Remove them from the team page [source/team/team.html.md.erb](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/source/team/team.html.md.erb)
1. Remove them from our GitHub team [terraform/github/locals.tf](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/github/locals.tf)
1. Remove them as a superadmin to our AWS landing zone [superadmins/main.tf](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-iam-superadmins/blob/main/main.tf#L5)
1. Run the modernisation-platform account Terraform for the above code change locally as a superuser (the CI user does not have permissions to delete users)
1. Remove them from the Modernisation Platform Google Group and Slack teams.
1. Remove them from pagerduty [terraform/pagerduty/locals.tf](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/pagerduty/locals.tf)
