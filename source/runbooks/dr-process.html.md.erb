# <%= current_page.data.title %>


This page is designed to help give direction in the event of a DR scenario.


It covers permanent loss of all infrastructure, temporary loss of all infrastructure, and loss of a single account.


## Diagnose


To find out the severity of the situation, check the AWS status page [here](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status ).


Regardless of which type of disaster recovery situation there is, you should contact AWS **immediately**, understanding if this is an outage for 1 hour or 1 month will dictate the next steps to take.


- If the issue is across all accounts, login to the Modernisation Platform account, and raise the highest level severity ticket, whilst also engaging with our AWS representative in the `#ext-aws` channel.


- If this issue is in one account, login to that account, and raise the highest level severity ticket if production, and also engaging with our AWS representative in the `#ext-aws` channel.


- If this occurs during working hours, create a huddle / meet. Outside of hours, call the second member of staff on call and post to the channel. With the PagerDuty alerts, incident channels will be created, too many to follow, so make a lead channel to coordinate.


## Internal Escalation


**Simon can you help fill in this**


Inform the following channels of the situation and put forward a contactable member of staff from our team.

`#modernisation-platform-alerts`



## Disaster Recovery Types


**Let’s work the problem, people. Let’s not make things worse by guessing.**


- London has been lost but **no services need to migrate**. [Click here]().
- London has been lost, and **all services need to migrate**. [Click here]().
- Loss of a **single account**. [Click here]().


## London has been lost but returning soon.


### Getting a decision


Once a ticket has been raised with AWS, and we have engaged with them and have total confirmation that the infrastructure will be returning within X number of minutes or hours, we will need to pass this information on for an informed decision to be made above.


Only when we have this, can we update users on what is next.


### Priority list


If there is limited availability, which is a possibility, these are the priority accounts that need to be checked before we can focus on member-accounts.



|Account|Information|
|----------------- |------------------------------------------------ |
|Core-Shared-Services|Creates the core shared services account resources. |
| Core-Network-Services | Creates the core networking account resources; this is the highest priority. |
|Core-Logging|Creates the core logging account resources |
|Core-Security|Creates the core security account resources |
|Cloud-Platform-Transit-Gateways|Across all regions. |
|Core-VPC-*|Creates the core VPC resources in the VPC accounts, needed after the core-networking-services. |
| Modernisation-Platform | Creates key resources such as S3 state buckets for the platform |


### Test Accounts


If there is limited availability, power off all infrastructure in the test accounts. All are useless until the platform is running.



## Single Account

Things to remember

- Dont forget the statefile, this could cause issues when rebuilding and generating plans.


### Will it be returning


If this is a test account, waiting may be the easier idea. If AWS can promise us this is a temporary issue with an estimated fix time, we can pass this to the team and agree our next step.


### Rebuild account


Assuming this is a production account with no time given to return, please follow the steps.


#### Workflows


Rather than rebuilding an account through workflows, I would run steps manually to easier debug issues, however, technically, you could start to run the account creation process with our github workflows.

**Member Accounts** - Located [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/actions/workflows/new-environment.yml), running the new environment workflow should begin the steps of an account creation for member accounts.

**Core Accounts** - Located [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/actions), on the left you will see the deployment workflows for all core based accounts, required for the building on the platform.

However, I would run manually just to monitor the plan, help troubleshoot issues, as sometimes these scenarios are not as cut and dry as all infrastructure has vanished from one account.


#### Manually


1.) Run a terraform plan against the production workspace, in modernisation-platform .

2.) All changes should appear, using your admin credentials, run an apply.

3.) Assuming the apply runs as planned, login to the account and check that vpcs, etc look correct.

4.) In modernisation-platform-environments , run terraform against the correct account.



### Things to remember


- Statefile for the lost account will exist, this might need to be removed.
- Any backups on the account or volumes will be lost.


## Disaster Recovery Running outside of London.


If the London infrastructure is to be down for the forseable future, running from another region is the next step.



### Informing teams


Firstly, inform the following channels of the situation and put forward a contactable member of staff from our team.


`#ask-modernisation-platform`


`#modernisation-platform`


`#modernisation-platform-alerts`


Supply the ETAs, lead incident numbers, links to where updates will be posted etc.


### Cross Region Infrastructure in the Platform


| Technology | Information | Replicated? | Replication Region |
|----------------- |------------------------------------------------ |------------- |-------------------- |
| S3 | Contains the platforms terraform state files. | Yes | eu-west-1 |
| KMS | Contains encryption keys for the platform. | No | - |
| Secrets Manger | Contains platform secrets. | Yes | eu-west-1 |
| IAM Policies | Across all regions. | - | - |
| DNS | Across all regions. | - | - |
| VPC | No VPCs currently exist for DR, only reserved. | - | - |

### Repo / Module List


These are the repositories owned by the Modernisation Platform.


The next step will be to create new tags for the current releases with any hardcoded region values changed.


`0.0.0`


Use the version number stated so these changes are easily recognisable. The version of these modules will then need to be updated in our


`Modernisation Platform` repository, along with any variables changed that are needed to. This should go in one large PR with many reviewers.

### Organisational Service Control Policies


Service control policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in the organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization. SCPs help you to ensure your accounts stay within your organization’s access control guidelines.


Currently in `eu-west-1` we can build what is required, however if this region was to change, we would need to check what is limited in which region.


### Contact AWS


As previously mentioned, contact AWS using the following steps


- Raise a ticket, highest priority.
- Contact our AWS representative for an update on the situation.
- Organise updates, if the situation changes, our approach might need to.


### Running the terraform


Once the modules have been updated, and tagged, as well as the PR merged to change any variable or hardcoded mentions of region in `Modernisation-Platform` we will need to begin the rebuild of the platform, starting with networking. The steps below outline which order to follow.


## Platform rebuild - Networking


This is a large undertaking, and has not been tested but discussed within the team.


### Networking Overview


Our [Networking Diagram](../concepts/networking/networking-diagram.html) shows a high level view of how shared
VPCs are connected.


Our [NetworkingApproach](../concepts/networking/networking-approach.html) discusses and
contains a detailed view of our shared VPCs.


Our [Transit Gateway](../how-vpcs-access-the-internet.html) and how VPCs access the internet.



## Stages

Rather than rebuilding the platform through workflows, I would run steps manually to easier debug issues, however, technically, you could start to run the account creation process with our github workflows.

Located [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/actions), on the left you will see the deployment workflows for all core based accounts, required for the building on the platform.


### VPCs and Subnets


1. Clone the mod-platform repo, change region in code. Whilst its as simple as a find and replace, modules are called and need changing, either locally and referenced locally, or in the module and pushed to git.
2. Core VPC rebuild. Provider would need to be eu-west-1, so check the permissions you have in that region with the credentials you are using. E.g. https://moj.awsapps.com/start/ when getting your credentials from here, make sure the region is correct.
3. Core Networking would be the next to run terraform on, checking the code and modules it uses for region references and changing them.


**With the infrastructure in London no longer available, we would use the original ranges**


### Transit Gateway


To rebuild the transit gateway in a new region, first find the code, located here, in core-network-services. https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/environments/core-network-services


Using the admin role, run a terraform plan and apply. This hasnt been done from scratch since the platforms creation, so expect to debug issues.


### Firewall - Needs work


We make use of AWS Network Firewalls in two ways. First, we use a centralised inspection VPC to control traffic entering and exiting the Modernisation Platform to and from internal Ministry of Justice services. Second, we use inline-inspection in our egress VPCs to control traffic exiting the Modernisation Platform to the internet.


Located in the Core-Network-Services account, DNS, networking and other network related infrastructure will be down.


The firewall rules can be located here - https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/environments/core-network-services/firewall-rules


Live data & non-live data.


Peer the new Transit grateway build in eu-west-1 to the MOJ transitgateway that is in eu-west-2 ???


### Account dependencies


|Account|Information|
|----------------- |------------------------------------------------ |
|Core-Shared-Services|Creates the core shared services account resources, AMIsand other services customers require are based in here. |
| Core-Network-Services | Creates the core networking account resources, and contains the transit gateway terraform, as well as firewall rules. |
|Core-Logging|Creates the core logging account resources, not essential but a part of the platform. |
|Core-Security|Creates the core security account resources |
|Cloud-Platform-Transit-Gateways|Across all regions. |
|Core-VPC-*|Creates the core VPC resources in the VPC accounts |
| Modernisation-Platform | Creates key resources such as S3 state buckets for the platform |
