# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This runbook outlines general steps to take in the event of a Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

## Identification of an attack

DDoS alarms should be configured for all production public facing interfaces, when these alarms are triggered they will send a notification through to the [#modernisation-platform-high-priority-alarms](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C03CY6451QT) channel. Documentation on these alarms can be read [here](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/runbooks/enabling-shield-advanced.html).

## Create an incident and follow the incident guidance

Follow the [general incident guidance](./manage-an-incident.html) to record the incident and gather information.

## DDoS Specific Actions

### View information about the attack

Detailed metrics on the type of DDoS attack can be found in Cloudwatch under the [DDoS metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html) in the affected account.

If the application has [automatic DDoS layer 7 mitigation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-automatic-app-layer-response.html) enabled, the attack may already be mitigated by this.  You can check this in the DDoS metrics or the [AWS Shield Events](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/events) area in the console.

### Report the attack to AWS

If the attack is on going and you require assistance from the AWS Shield Response Team (SRT) to help create additional WAF mitigation rules, raise a [support case](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-srt-contacting.html) in the application account.

If the account has [proactive engagement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-srt-proactive-engagement.html) with Route53 health checks enabled AWS will contact the provided contacts.

### Modify WAF rules

If you are confident in modifying the WAF rules to mitigate the attack you can do this through the infrastructure code as per normal changes.

Alternatively the SRT team can assist with creating these rules.

## Notify users and security

Follow the [general incident guidance](general-incident.html) to notify users and the security team.
