## Introduction

The [Modernisation Platform Environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments) repository contains user application infrastructure as code and deployment workflows. This allows users of the Modernisation Platform to manage their own infrastructure and deployments into their various environments. 

## Notes on reviewing

Only 1 approving review is required for any pull requests which are raised which means that in the majority of cases, members can approve their own PRs with a review being made by another member of their GitHub team.

In certain cases the MP team need to review infrastructure changes being made to ensure that the use-case is deemed acceptable. These include:

1. Any changes made to files specified in the [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) file which only show `@ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform` as an owner e.g. `**/platform_*.tf` files

1. Any changes which are highlighted by the [`terraform-plan-evaluator.sh`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/blob/main/scripts/terraform-plan-evaluator.sh) shell script. This script is built in to the [`reusable_terraform_plan_apply.yml`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/blob/main/.github/workflows/reusable_terraform_plan_apply.yml) workflow and if any of the resources listed e.g. `aws_eks_cluster` are found in the Terraform plan stage the build will be marked as **failed**, preventing deployments.

## Process for approving PRs

To approve these PRs at least 1 member of the `@ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform` Github team will need to add an approving review. 

**Additionally**, in the case of changes which are highlighted by the [`terraform-plan-evaluator.sh`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/blob/main/scripts/terraform-plan-evaluator.sh) shell script,  a comment will be left on the PR as follows: 

>_Terraform plan evaluation detected changes to resources that require approval from @ministryofjustice/modernsation-platform - please contact #ask-modernisation-platform for assistance_

This will also add a "Requested Changes" review from the `modernisation-platform-ci` user. A member of the `@ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform` Github team will need to dismiss this review in order for the deployment to be merged/applied successfully.
