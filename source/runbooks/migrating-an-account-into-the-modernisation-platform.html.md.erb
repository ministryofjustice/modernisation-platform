This runbook outlines general steps to take in order to migrate an existing Ministry of Justice Amazon Web Services account into the Modernisation Platform.

## Outline

On occasion, we may be asked to bring an existing AWS account into the Modernisation Platform for ongoing management and application of account baselines.

We can make use of some of our existing processes and our `member-unrestricted` AWS Organizations Unit to import accounts, apply baselines, and provide SSO access.

The following high-level steps need to be undertaken:

* Prepare account
* Create entries for account in Modernisation Platform repository
* Import manageable resources

## Preparing an account for import into the Modernisation Platform

You can make use of the [AWS guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reset-root-password.html) to log into the account of interest as the root user.

You will want to check that the account being migrated:
* Conforms to Modernisation Platform naming standards (eg, all lower-case letters, with no spaces as separators).
* Has been removed from any Terraform statefiles that manage the account.
* Has been removed from management in code.

## Importing an account into the Modernisation Platform

You will want to create a branch in GitHub in the Modernisation Platform repository with relevant `environments/*.json` values
* The account-type will be `unrestricted`

You will want to switch your local branch in GitHub to the one with the newly-created/amended `environments/*.json` values in order to import information into Terraform.
* Ensure you are in the `terraform/environments` directory
* Import the `module.environments.aws_organizations_account.accounts["$account-name"] $account-id`
* Import the `module.environments.random_string.email-address["$account-name"] $account-email-address`
* Merge your new branch into `main`.

It is likely that you will also need to import resources into Terraform state for the [account baselines](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-baselines).
You will do this through the `terraform/environments/boostrap/member-bootstrap` directory in the relevant workspace(s).
