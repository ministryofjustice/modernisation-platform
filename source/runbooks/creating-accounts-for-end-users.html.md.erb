## Overview

Here’s an example of an account request, and the steps that were taken in order to create it.  There are links to pull requests and the stages they need to be opened and merged, as well as references and explanations as to why.

## Information Required

Customers will fill out the new-environment template via our public repository [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/issues/new/choose) and supply the required information.

|Attribute|Description|
---|---|
|Application name (file name)|The name must be in lowercase and a maximum of 30 characters. For our example we have `data-and-insights-wepi`|
|GitHub team slug|This is the name of your GitHub team that will be accessing the environment. Environments are accessed via single sign on (SSO), so to give people permissions to access your environment you just have to add them to your GitHub team.|
|Access|For our example, sandbox access has been requested. To read more about access levels, click [here](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/user-guide/creating-environments.html#application-name)|
|Environment|This is one of the four valid environments, development, test, preproduction or production|
|Tags| application, business-unit and owner are in tags, and they are used to tag your AWS resources inside of your account.|
|Additional features| This example has no additional features, but things VPN endpoints and extended DNS zones are requestable.|

## New Environment Files

#### 1. Create a new environment file

`environments/$account-name.json`

See an example file [here](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/user-guide/creating-environments.html#example-json-files).

> Note - If you are adding an environment to an existing application you can add the new environment block to this file, you do not need to create another.

#### 2. Update the `expected.rego`

Update the [`expected.rego`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/policies/environments/expected.rego) file with the newly added account name.

This is to make sure that none of the json files gets accidentally deleted. This is going to be validated with the [opa-policies](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/opa-policies.yml) GitHub Actions workflow.

#### 3. Create a pull request for the changes made in steps 1 and 2

This will trigger the [`new-environment workflow`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/new-environment.yml), which will run its check-environments-deployment-plan. You can see what will change in the output from GitHub Actions.

#### 4. Merge the pull request

This will run the [`new-environment` workflow](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/new-environment.yml) to create a new AWS account.

This will also run the [`new-environment-files` workflow](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/new-environment-files.yml) which generates two new pull requests if this is the first environment of the new application:

1. Creating application files in the `modernisation-platform` repo.
1. Creating application files in the `modernisation-platform-environments` repo.

> Note - These PRs are only created the first time an environment for an application is created, eg the first time you create a new application.json file. If you add to an existing environment the PRs will not be created.

#### 5. Merge the pull request created in the modernisation-platform repo (step 4.1)

#### 6. Edit the pull request created in the modernisation-platform-environments repo (step 4.2)

Edit the PR to comment out any environments that are not used in the GitHub Actions workflow file (there is a matrix for development/test and one for preproduction/production).

See [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/pull/1206/commits/1a8c006375fa5b7ae6ee2b9460e580ec0f645641) for an example.

If the files already exist and no PR is created, create a new PR amending the exising application GitHub Actions file.

> Note - The plan will fail on these PRs due to the networking not yet being complete.  This is fine, the goal of these PRs is to create the necessary files, not make deployments.

## Networking Stage

This stage sets up [Resource Access Manager (RAM) sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html) to share the relevant business unit subnet sets to the application account.

Business unit VPCs and subnet sets are already created for all the MoJ business units.  If an additional VPC or subnet set is needed, see guidance [here.](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/runbooks/creating-vpcs.html).

#### 1. Add the application to the relevant subnets

Add the application to the subnet sets in [`environments/networks](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/environments-networks).

Most applications will be added to the `general` subnet set.  If they need something different see the above guidance on creating VPCs and subnet sets.

#### 2. Update the OPA policies

Update the [`policies/networking/expected.rego`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/policies/networking/expected.rego) file to include newly added environments. This is to ensure that none of the subnets get accidentally deleted. Here's an example of a pull request for this [stage](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/pull/2127/files ).

> Note remember to add the full environment names, eg `data-and-insights-wepi-development` not just the application name.

#### 3. Create a pull request for the changes in step 1 and 2

This will then kick off `core-vpc-<env>-demployment` pipelines and run `terraform plan`, `terraform apply` and the `scripts/member-account-ram-association.sh` script for the RAM share.

> If the RAM share script fails to run on the merge for any reason, it will have to be run manually in the relevant application folder [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/environments).

The pipeline will also generate a PR for the ram share. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/pull/2203)

#### 4. Merge in the generated PR from step 3

## Checking its creation

You should be able to see the account or accounts created [here](https://moj.awsapps.com/start/#/)

Logging into the account, you should be able to view the subnets, and be displayed with
