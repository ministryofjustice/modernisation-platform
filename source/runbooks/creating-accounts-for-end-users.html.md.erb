## Overview

Hereâ€™s an example of an account request, and the steps that were taken in order to create it.  There are links to pull requests and the stages they need to be opened and merged, as well as references and explanations as to why.

## Information Required

Customers will fill out the new-environment template via our public repository [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/issues/new/choose) and supply the required information.

### Application name
The name must be in lowercase and a maximum of 30 characters. For our example we have `data-and-insights-wepi`
### GitHub team slug
This is the name of your GitHub team that will be accessing the environment. Environments are accessed via single sign on (SSO), so to give people permissions to access your environment you just have to add them to your GitHub team. The file containing them can be found [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/github/locals.tf)
### Access
For our example, sandbox access has been requested. To read more about access levels, click [here](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/user-guide/creating-environments.html#application-name)
### Environment name
This is usually based on the team name, with a the corresponding environment after e.g. `data-and-insights-wepi-development`
### Tags
Usually application, business-unit and owner are in tags, and they are used to tag your AWS resources inside of your account.
### Additional features
This example has no additional features, but things like bastion access, VPN endpoints and extended DNS zones are requestable.

## New Environment Files

Example file [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/new-environment-files.yml)

The new-environment-files action has the following trigger on push:

    paths:
      - environments/**.json
      - environments-networks/**.json
    branches:
      - main

To kick off the environment creation process, we add `environments/$account-name.json` which causes our new-environment-files action to trigger.

Example file [here](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/user-guide/creating-environments.html#example-json-files)

Additionally, the [expected.rego](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/policies/environments/expected.rego) file must be updated with the newly added account name. This is to make sure that none of the json files gets accidentally deleted. This is going to be validated with the [opa-policies](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/opa-policies.yml) GH actions workflow.

** Submitting this PR will kick off the new-environments workflow, which will run its check-environments-deployment-plan. You can see what will change in the output from github actions

** Merging this PR will generate two pull requests. One in the `modernisation-platform` repo which can be merged straight away, and one in the `modernisation-platform-environments` repo, which is merged last (in the __Step 3__ of the __Network Stage__, NOTE: at this stage GH actions will most likely fail).

## Network Stage

For this example, we will be joining an existing subnet-set. For new business units, work will need to be done beforehand, however that's not the standard procedure and usually a one off. If you are working with a new business unit, read about the steps required [here.](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/runbooks/creating-vpcs.html)

#### Step one
Check that you have completed the previous steps, so far you should have added the github-slug, the json files under environments, updated the `policies/environments/expected.rego` file and merged the PR in modernisation-platform containing the terraform files.

#### Step two
Add the `environments/networks`. Here's an example of a pull request for this [stage](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/pull/2127/files ).

This will then generate a PR for the ram share, merge this. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/pull/2203)

#### Step three
Once complete, the pull request raised earlier in  `modernisation-platform-environments` can be merged. Example [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/pull/805/files ). The pipeline will create this.

## Checking its creation

You should be able to see the account or accounts created [here](https://moj.awsapps.com/start/#/)

Logging into the account, you should be able to view the subnets, and be displayed with
