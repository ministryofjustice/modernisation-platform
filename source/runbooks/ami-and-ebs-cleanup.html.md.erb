## Overview

This runbook explains how to use the **[AMI and EBS cleanup pipeline](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/blob/main/.github/workflows/ami_cleanup.yml)** to identify and remove unused Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and unattached EBS volumes in Modernisation Platform environments.  

The goal is to reduce costs and keep environments clean by automatically deleting resources that are no longer needed.

The cleanup runs in two phases:

1. **Preview (dry run)** — lists candidates for deletion and produces a summary and  CSV reports.
2. **Live (deletion)** — deregisters unused AMIs, deletes associated snapshots, and removes unattached EBS volumes.

## When to use this runbook

Run this workflow when:

- You want to audit old or unused AMIs and volumes.  
- You want to safely delete aged resources to reduce storage costs.  

## Prerequisites

- The target environment/s must already exist under GitHub [Environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/settings/environments) in the Modernisation Platform Environments repository, with appropriate approvers configured to authorize the cleanup workflow before it runs.

## How to trigger the cleanup

1. Go to the [**Modernisation Platform Environments**](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments) repository in GitHub.  

2. Select the [**Actions**](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/actions) tab.  
3. Choose [**Cloud Clean Up AMI and EBS**](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/actions/workflows/ami_cleanup.yml) in the left-hand list.  
4. Click **Run workflow** (top right) and put in the inputs below to start the job

| **Input**         | **Description**                      | **Example**                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| application       | Application short name               | cooker                           |
| environments      | Comma-separated list of environments | development,test,preproduction   |
| cleanup_type      | What to clean: ami, ebs, or both     | both (default)                   |

### Phase 1 – Preview (dry run)

- Applies age filters:
  - Default: AMIs ≥ 3 months old, EBS ≥ 1 month old.  
- Excludes:
  - AMIs referenced in Terraform (`ami = "..."` or `ami_name = "..."`).
  - AMIs in use by running instances.
  - AMIs or snapshots tagged `AwsBackup`, `Retain=true`, or `Backup=true`.
- Generates reports and a cleanup summary in Github actions showing ami, snapshots and ebs candidates to be deleted.

### Phase 2 – Live (deletion)
- Runs after the dry run and requires approval from the team before execution.
- Uses the same filters to confirm candidates.
- Deregisters unused AMIs and deletes their associated snapshots.  
- Performs a snapshot fallback pass to remove any orphaned AMI snapshots.
- Deletes unattached EBS volumes older than the threshold.
- Produces updated CSV reports and summary showing what was deleted or skipped.


## Safety and rollback

- AMI deregistration does **not** affect running EC2 instances.  
- Snapshots are deleted only if the corresponding AMI was deleted.  
- EBS volumes that are **attached** are never deleted.  
- AMIs or snapshots with `AwsBackup`, `Retain=true`, or `Backup=true` tags are always preserved.  
- All candidate commands are written to artifact files before execution for traceability.
