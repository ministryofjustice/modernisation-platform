# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## Introduction

We have a dedicated engineer to answer queries in the [#ask-modernisation-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01A7QK5VM1) Slack channel and to respond to high priority incidents during the day.

Other engineers may also complete any of these activities at any time and we encourage all team members to help where they can.

## Times

Ask channel support is between 9am-4pm, the engineer on the Duty Rota may also answer queries either side of these times as it fits with their working day.

## How

Team members will decide amongst themselves who is on rota for a particular day.  Do not volunteer to go on rota if you have a day full of meetings or other commitments.

Team members should not be on the rota more than 3 days in a sprint.

Communicate if you are away from the keyboard so that other team members can cover.

## Responsibilities

### High priority

These are the core activities to undertake whilst on the rota.

| Activity | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| Monitor and respond to the [#ask-modernisation-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01A7QK5VM1) channel | Respond to queries in the Ask channel.  You do not need to solve them yourself but you are responsible to ensuring they are replied to and that the query is addressed. |
| Monitor and respond to high priority incidents in the [#modernisation-platform-high-priority-alarms](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C03CY6451QT) channel | [Runbooks](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/#runbooks)
| Monitor and respond to AWS Health issues | Emails are sent to the team inbox if there are issues with any of the Modernisation Platform managed accounts.  Review these emails and create issues for our backlog if needed. |
| Monitor and respond to TVMSOC emails | Emails are sent to the team inbox when the TVMSOC team are made aware of potential security issues. Review these emails and either let TVMSOC know this is not an issue for the Modernisation Platform or that we are investigating. If appropriate raise an issue. This ticket might need to be addressed immediately.

### Optional

These are optional activities if there are no high priority activities to do. Do not feel you have to do all of these, these are suggestions of activities.

| Review and fix GitHub code scanning issues | In each repository we have regular code scans which raise issues, these can be found on the `Security` tab in each Modernsation Platform repository.  Review and fix. |

### Do not do

No board work is to be done at all.  This is to ensure that engineers do not feel pressured to complete board tasks as well as rota tasks.
