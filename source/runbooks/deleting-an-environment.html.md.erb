> Note: This process is cannot be undone. All resources in an AWS account will be deleted.

In the Modernisation Platform, we run a pipeline to create AWS accounts using the `aws_organizations_account` Terraform resource.

The `aws_organizations_account` cannot, and does not, delete AWS accounts if removed from the configuration. It attempts to move the AWS account from AWS Organizations to a standalone account, which should fail.

Therefore, there are a few things to do to delete an environment, in this order:

1. Get the AWS accounts root IAM user's email address
1. Remove the environment definition from `environments/*.json`
1. Remove the AWS account from Modernisation Platform management
1. Delete the `terraform workspace` wherever it appears
1. Delete the actual AWS account

## Getting the root IAM user's email address

You need the root IAM user's email address to delete the AWS account in the last step, so note it down.

You can get this from the SSO log on page if you have access to the account via SSO, if not it can be found in the Terraform state.

To do this, `cd` into `terraform environments` and find the resource in the state:

- `cd terraform/environments`
- Use [temporary AWS Credentials](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/user-guide/getting-aws-credentials.html#getting-aws-credentials) or [AWS-Vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) to source the **Modernisation Platform** credentials in your terminal
- `terraform init`
- `terraform state list`

To find the email address, run:

- `terraform state show <resource reference>`

```bash
$ cd terraform/environments
$ terraform state list
$ terraform state show 'module.environments.aws_organizations_account.accounts["core-vpc-non-live-data"]'

resource "aws_organizations_account" "accounts" {
    ...
    email                      = "..." <- This will be the email address for the root IAM user
    ...
    tags                       = {
        "application"      = "modernisation-platform"
        "business-unit"    = "Platforms"
        "environment-name" = "production"
        "is-production"    = "true"
        "owner"            = "Modernisation Platform: modernisation-platform@digital.justice.gov.uk"
    }
}
```

## Removing the AWS account from Modernisation Platform management

You need to remove the resource from the Terraform state where it gets created so Terraform no longer has knowledge of it. You don't need to remove the organisational unit, as Terraform will remove those if they're not used by anything else.

To do this, `cd` into `terraform environments` and find the resource in the state:

- `cd terraform/environments`
- Use [temporary AWS Credentials](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/user-guide/getting-aws-credentials.html#getting-aws-credentials) or [AWS-Vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) to source the **Modernisation Platform** credentials in your terminal
- `terraform init`
- `terraform state list`

To remove it, run:

- `terraform state rm <resource reference>`

For example, to remove the environment for `core-vpc-non-live-data`:

```bash
$ cd terraform/environments
$ terraform state list
...
module.environments.aws_organizations_account.accounts["core-logging-production"]
module.environments.aws_organizations_account.accounts["core-network-services-production"]
module.environments.aws_organizations_account.accounts["core-sandbox-dev"]
module.environments.aws_organizations_account.accounts["core-security-production"]
module.environments.aws_organizations_account.accounts["core-shared-services-production"]
module.environments.aws_organizations_account.accounts["core-vpc-non-live-data"]
module.environments.aws_organizations_account.accounts["core-vpc-production"]
...
$ terraform state rm 'module.environments.aws_organizations_account.accounts["core-vpc-non-live-data"]'
Removed module.environments.aws_organizations_account.accounts["core-vpc-non-live-data"]
Successfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
```

## Removing the environment definition

To ensure the account isn't recreated after removing it from the `terraform state`, remove it from its `environments/*.json` file.

For example, to remove `core-vpc-non-live-data` from the `core-vpc` set of accounts:

```json
{
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "production",
      "access": []
    },
    {
      "name": "non-live-data",
      "access": []
    }
  ],
  "tags": {
    "application": "modernisation-platform",
    "business-unit": "Platforms",
    "owner": "Modernisation Platform: modernisation-platform@digital.justice.gov.uk"
  }
}
```

should become:

```json
{
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "production",
      "access": []
    }
  ],
  "tags": {
    "application": "modernisation-platform",
    "business-unit": "Platforms",
    "owner": "Modernisation Platform: modernisation-platform@digital.justice.gov.uk"
  }
}
```

If you are removing **all the environments** for an application, you can **delete** the **whole json file**.

Remove the accounts from the relevant `environments-networking/business-environment.json` file. (not required if non member account and not using shared networking)

Update the [OPA polices](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/policies) by removing references in the following files

- [`policies/environments/expected.rego`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/-policies/environments/expected.rego)

- [`policies/networking/expected.rego`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/policies/networking/expected.rego)

Before merging in these changes, complete the rest of the steps in this document.

## Delete Terraform resources for the environment

For the following repos, switch to the corresponding workspace and run a `terraform destroy` to ensure any resources such as DNS entries created in shared accounts are deleted and not orphaned.

`modernisation-platform/terraform/environments/<application-name>`

`modernisation-platform-environments/terraform/environments/<application-name>` (not required if non member account)

> Note that you need to assume the [backend role](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/user-guide/running-terraform-plan-locally.html#run-terraform-plan) for the Terraform init command in the `modernisation-platform-environments` repo

> Some resources such as s3 buckets cannot be destroyed until you manually empty all the objects and versions in them

## Delete Terraform workspaces for the environment

After completing this, you will need to delete the application terraform workspaces in the following locations. Note, you will need to switch to the default workspace before deleting the workspace, see an example command below.

`modernisation-platform/terraform/environments/bootstrap/delegate-access/`

`modernisation-platform/terraform/environments/bootstrap/secure-baselines/`

`modernisation-platform/terraform/environments/bootstrap/single-sign-on/`

`modernisation-platform/terraform/environments/bootstrap/member-bootstrap/`

`modernisation-platform-environments/terraform/environments/<application-name>` (not required if non member account)

`modernisation-platform/terraform/environments/<application-name>`
For example:

```bash
terraform workspace select default
terraform workspace delete -force core-vpc-non-live-data
```

> This will not delete the resources that are set up by the Terraform configuration. It will only delete the Terraform reference to the workspace. You will need to delete the AWS account properly.

## Remove Environment Files (\*only if removing all environments for an application)

If you delete the last environment and there are no more environments for the application, you should delete all of the environment files in the following folders:

`modernisation-platform/terraform/environments/<application-name>`

`modernisation-platform-environments/terraform/environments/<application-name>`

`modernisation-platform-environments/.github/workflows/<application-name>`

After following the above steps, you need to move the account to the root OU before deleting the actual AWS account that the environment was linked to.

## Move the account to the root organizational unit

> Note that a user with root account permissions will need to do this.

This is to move the account out of an organizational unit where there is an SCP preventing any actions by the root user.

Log into the AWS Console and navigate to AWS Organizations, find the account and move it to the `root` OU.

Now the AWS account can be deleted.

## Delete the actual AWS account

> This process cannot be undone. Proceed carefully.

Follow the [AWS documentation on closing an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/close-account.html#closing-the-account).

You will need access to the [AWS - notifications](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.justice.gov.uk/g/aws) Google Group which will receive the password reset email.

## Move the account to the closed accounts organizational unit

> Note that a user with root account permissions will need to do this. Please post in #ask-operations-engineering about it, or message the MP teams TA/Lead Webops Engineer.

Log into the AWS Console and navigate to AWS Oraganizations, find the account and move it to the `Closed accounts` OU.

## Merge in your file changes

Merging in your file changes will trigger Terraform to perform the remaining clean up needed.

## Delete Github environments

Navigate to https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/settings/environments and delete the relevant GitHub environments.
