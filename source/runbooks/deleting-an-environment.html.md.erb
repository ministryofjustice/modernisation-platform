> Note: This process cannot be undone. All resources in an AWS account will be deleted.

> You will need to **complete the actions** below in as **short a time frame as possible**. Certain workflows such as [Terraform: New environment](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/new-environment.yml) will re-create accounts/workspaces which you are trying to delete if it runs mid-way through your progress. Ideally warn the MP team **not to merge any PRs** whilst you carry out these actions.

This runbook describes the process required to delete an environment/s.

## Running account deletion scripts locally

We have bash scripts that are designed to automate the process of decommissioning an AWS account. The scripts perform the following tasks, in this order;

* Removes the AWS account from Modernisation Platform state management
* Removes the environment definition in `environments/*.json`
* Deletes Terraform resources for the environment (in the MP and MP Environments repos)
* Deletes Terraform workspaces for the environment in `terraform/environments/bootstrap/*`
* Removes Environment Files (\*only if removing all environments for an application)

>Be aware that some resources such as s3 buckets cannot be destroyed until you manually empty all the objects and versions in them.

>Ensure that you have fetched the most recent updates in your local MP and MPE directories by executing a `git pull` command.

>Ensure that you have deleted all local `.terraform` and `.terraform.lock.hcl` files 


To use the scripts, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [account-deletion folder](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/scripts/account-deletion) and create a config.txt file within it
1. Open the [example-config.txt file](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/scripts/account-deletion/example-config.txt), copy its contents, and paste them into your newly created config.txt file.
1. Modify the config.txt file to include variables specific to your AWS account deletion task.
1. Open your terminal and ensure your current working directory is account-deletion.
1. Make the script executable by running the command: `chmod +x delete-accounts.sh`
1. Execute the script using the command: `./delete-accounts.sh`
1. While the script is running you will need to respond to prompts to confirm your actions at various stages

>The script execution logs will be written to a file called `execution_log.txt` which show the progress being made and help to debug any issues that may arise.

>If the script fails at any point you can choose to re-run the `account-deletion.sh` script or manually run one of the individual scripts that it calls.

## Move the account to the root organizational unit

> Note that a user with root account permissions will need to do this. Contact the MP teams TA/Lead Webops Engineer.

This is to move the account out of an organizational unit where there is an SCP preventing any actions by the root user.

Log into the AWS Console and navigate to AWS Organizations, find the account and move it to the `root` OU.

Now the AWS account can be deleted.

## Delete the actual AWS account

> This process cannot be undone. Proceed carefully.

Follow the [AWS documentation on closing an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/close-account.html#closing-the-account).

You need the root IAM user's email address to delete the AWS account. You can get this from the [AWS SSO login page](https://moj.awsapps.com/start#/)

You will need access to the [AWS - notifications](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.justice.gov.uk/g/aws) Google Group which will receive the password reset email.

## Move the account to the closed accounts organizational unit

> Note that a user with root account permissions will need to do this. Contact the MP teams TA/Lead Webops Engineer.

Log into the AWS Console and navigate to AWS Oraganizations, find the account and move it to the `Closed accounts` OU.

## Merge in your file changes

Raise a PR to merge in your file changes in both the MP and MP Environments repositories which will trigger Terraform to perform the remaining clean up needed.

## Delete Github environments

Navigate to [https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/settings/environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/settings/environments) and delete the relevant GitHub environments.

Check for any automated PRs that have been raised in the MP Environments repo to update the `.github/CODEOWNERS` file. Here is an [example PR](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/pull/5317/files). These will need to be merged in.
