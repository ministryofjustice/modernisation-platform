## Introduction

We don't have many secrets on stored on the Modernisation Platform, but they are rotated regularly, every 180 days.

This guide advises where secrets are stored and how to rotate them.

## Runbooks

### GitHub MP CI User PAT

This runbook describes the process for rotating the **github_ci_user_pat** secret.

1. Retrieve the MP GitHub credentials by logging in to the AWS [Modernisation Platform account](https://moj.awsapps.com/start#/) with **AdministratorAccess**
2. Navigate to the Secrets Manager [github_ci_user_password](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/secret?name=github_ci_user_password&region=eu-west-2) secret and click `Retrieve secret value`
3. Use the credentials provided to log in to [GitHub](https://github.com)
4. Once logged in click on the profile icon and then **Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic) > Generate new token (classic)**
5. Fill out the details: 
    * In the **Note** field give the token a descriptive name e.g. `"Modernisation Platform GitHub Terraform"`
    * Set **Expiration** value to `"No Expiration"`
    * Set Scopes by ticking the following boxes:
        * workflow
        * admin:org (write:org | read:org | manage_runners:org)
        * user:email
        * project (read:project)
6. Click `Generate token` and then copy the token to your clipboard
7. Navigate to the Secrets Manager [github_ci_user_pat](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/secret?name=github_ci_user_pat&region=eu-west-2) secret and click `Retrieve secret value`
8. Click `Edit` and replace the token with the new one and click `Save`
9. Run the [Github resources Workflow](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/actions/workflows/terraform-github.yml) manually on the main branch. This will populate the GH secret with the value that you have just updated in AWS Secrets Manager.
10. Wait for another workflow to run which uses the secret to confirm that the new token has taken effect successfully. (The secrets status will show as *"Last used within the last week"*)
11. When you are confident the new secret is working successfully you can delete the old PAT token in GitHub

### GitHub MP CI User Environments Repo PAT

This runbook describes the process for rotating the **github_ci_user_environments_repo_pat** secret.

2. Navigate to the Secrets Manager [github_ci_user_password](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/secret?name=github_ci_user_password&region=eu-west-2) secret and click `Retrieve secret value`
3. Use the credentials provided to log in to [GitHub](https://github.com)
4. Once logged in click on the profile icon and then **Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (Fine-grained tokens) > GITHUB_CI_USER_ENVIRONMENTS_REPO_PAT**
5. Click `Regenerate token` and then copy the token to your clipboard
6. Navigate to the Secrets Manager [github_ci_user_environments_repo_pat](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/secret?name=github_ci_user_environments_repo_pat&region=eu-west-2) secret and click `Retrieve secret value`
7. Click `Edit` and replace the token with the new one and click `Save`

### Slack Webhook URL

This runbook describes the process for rotating the **slack_webhook_url** secret.

1. Log into the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Select `Modernisation Platform Alerts` App Name from your apps, then choose `Incoming Webhooks`.
3. From there, click on `Add New Webhook to the Workspace`, and select 'modernisation-platform' as the channel name.
4. Copy the Webhook URL and replace it in both [GitHub secrets](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/settings/secrets/actions/SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL) and also in the [secrets manager]().
5. Navigate to the Secrets Manager [slack_webhook_url](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/secret?name=slack_webhook_url&region=eu-west-2) secret and click `Retrieve secret value`
6. Click `Edit` and replace the secret value with the new one and click `Save`
7. Run the [Github resources Workflow](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/actions/workflows/terraform-github.yml) manually on the main branch. This will populate the GH secret with the value that you have just updated in AWS Secrets Manager. 
8. Wait for another workflow to run which uses the secret to confirm that the new token has taken effect successfully. (The secrets status will show as *"Last used within the last week"*)

### Cortex Xsiam User Access Key

This runbook covers the rotation of the access key for the cortex_xsiam_user account in the Core Logging account.

1. Email the Monitoring & Integration team via monitoring-and-integration-platform@justice.gov.uk to confirm a new key pair is being created which will need to be applied to their Cortex Xsiam system.
2. Once they have responded confirming they are ready for the key, create a new one for the cortex_xsiam_user in the Core Logging account and email that to the named person who responded. This avoids the key being shared too widely.
3. When the M&I team have confirmed the new key has been applied and the console shows it in use, delete the existing key.
