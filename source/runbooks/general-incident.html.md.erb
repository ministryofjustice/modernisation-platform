This runbooks outlines general steps to take in the event of a major incident.

Types of incident that would be considered major are:

* Complete loss of the platform
* Loss of an AWS account
* Loss of networking

## Identification of an incident

This may come from various sources, users, alerts or other.

## Gather information

Gather all the information on the incident that you can and record it on a Google Docs sheet in the [Incident folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zlL8Uoh4jequ9_np_NcthCO6dMsqBqhe), for example:

- Who is affected?
- What is affected?
- What is the impact?
- When did this start?
- Were there any changes recently?
- Are there any [AWS health dashboard issues](https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/account/dashboard/open-issues)

## Communicate with the team and users

Post in the [#modernisation-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C013RM6MFFW) channel using @modernisation_platform_team to make all team members aware.
Post in the [#modernisation-platform-update](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C02L5MCJ12N) channel that an incident has occured, and a brief description of the incident.

Communicate regularly with users, even if there is no resolution to keep them aware of progress.

If the incident is a security incident [report it to the security team](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/).

Example message:

```
:alert: Incident - Transit Gateway Failure :alert:
Issue: We have identified issues with the transit gateway connection to the wider MoJ
Impact: Applications that communicate across the wider MoJ network my have issues or stop working
We are working to resolved this problem, a support ticket with AWS has been raised and escalated. Further updates will be posted in this channel.
```

## Attempt to resolve the issue

Ensure any attempts to resolve the issue are in code and reviewed, or if any manual intervention is needed, this is agreed with the team and done as a pairing session.

It is important that you do not make any changes until action is agreed by another team member. Incidents can quickly be made worse if the incorrect course of action is taken.

## Log a support ticket

If the incident cannot be resolved within the team or if the issue lies with a 3rd party log a support ticket with the 3rd party.
For AWS support, log a call in the AWS account affected.

3rd Party | How to log a support ticket | Escalation process
---|---|---
AWS| [Creating a support case](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/case-management.html)| On the case, or post in #ext-awssupport

## Resolution

- When the incident is resolved let users know.
- Arrange a time for an incident retro so that any lessons from the incident can be learned.
