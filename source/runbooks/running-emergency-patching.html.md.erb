# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## Requirements

- A list of all account numbers that you want to run the patch on.
- The specific patch and version, saved in a yaml format in the core-shared-services accounts s3 bucket. (Bucket can be pre existing, but the module creates an s3 bucket if one is needed)

## Stages

1. Login to the core-shared-services account.
2. Create a yaml file in the s3 bucket with the format listed below. (This will be used to run the patch on the accounts)
3. From the Systems Manager page in the core-shared-services account, select automation.
4. Select Run Automation, and select the document 'cross-account-single-patching-automation'
5. Select Multi-account and Region option.
6. Input the yaml file location you created in step 2, and also input the account numbers you want to run the patch on.
7. Click run. This will run the patch on all the accounts you specified, with the patch you specified.

## Finding the emergency patch doc

- Login to the core-shared-services account. From here, go to AWS Systems Manager and select Automation.
- Select the 'Automation' under 'Change Management' and select 'Execute Automation'.
- Select the 'cross-account-single-patching-automation' document, which will be in 'Owned by me' section.

## Cross-account-single-patching-automation

- Select the 'cross-account-single-patching-automation' document, and click next.
- Select the Multi-account and Region option.
- Type in the accounts to run against, in the Target accounts and Regions field.

## Parameters

List of parameters and what they represent

### Operation
Usage: Required.
- Select the operation you want to run. This will be 'Install' for an emergency patch.

### AssociationId
Usage: Optional.
- AssociationId is the ID of an existing association in State Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager. It's used by Patch Manager to add compliance data to a specified association.

### Snapshot ID
Usage: Optional.
- Snapshot ID is a unique ID (GUID) used by Patch Manager to ensure that a set of managed nodes that are patched in a single operation all have the exact same set of approved patches.

### RebootOption
Usage: Optional.
- Fine with the default of Default: RebootIfNeeded, rather than NoReboot.

### BaselineOverride
Usage: Optional.
- You can define patching preferences at runtime using the BaselineOverride parameter. This baseline override is maintained as a JSON object in an S3 bucket. It ensures patching operations use the provided baselines that match the host operating system instead of applying the rules from the default patch baseline

### Install Override List

- This argument is required to specify the patch to run. This will be the location of the yaml file in the s3 bucket.
