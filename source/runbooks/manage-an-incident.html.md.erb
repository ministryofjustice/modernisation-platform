# Incident Process

This document describes our incident handling process.

## 1. Confirm that the event constitutes an incident

> If this is a security breach, also report it [here](https://goo.gl/forms/frsB1h8AGv3Zefwq2)

We define an incident as an event which:

* is unplanned, and
* impacts end users or our direct users (developers and engineers), or
* degrades user-facing services, or
* increases risk to production services

If this event does not constitute an incident, the appropriate response is probably to [raise an issue](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/issues/new/choose) in our GitHub repository.

Once you are confident that you have an incident, declare it as such.

## 2. Declare the incident

From any channel in Slack you can use the Modernisation Platform incident slack tool to declare an incident.

`/modernisation-platform-incident Something's happened`

Declaring the incident will launch a form for you to complete. Once the form is saved, in the `#modernisation-platform-incidents` channel, click the `Create comms channel` button to create a dedicated Slack channel for this incident.

At your discretion, you may also wish to notify users now via [ask-modernisation-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01A7QK5VM1) and/or [modernisation-platform-update](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C02L5MCJ12N), however you may prefer to leave this until later in the process, when more information is available.

## 3. Assign roles

The two roles which **must** be filled for every incident are the **Incident Lead** and the **Scribe**.

> In rare cases, the same person might fill both roles, but this is discouraged because it generally leads to poor record keeping.

To fill these roles, ask for volunteers from the team, either verbally or via #modernisation-platform. In the unlikely event that you don't get any volunteers, appoint someone.

### 3.1 Incident Lead

**Responsibilities**:

* coordinate our response to the incident
* decide on any additional roles required (e.g. a communications lead may be required)
* ensure that all required roles are filled
* ensure that all tasks which need to be handled are being done
* make the final decision whenever we need to choose a course of action
* set the schedule for any regular team check-ins, if those are deemed necessary
* declare the incident closed, when appropriate
* ensure that the post-incident process is followed

> NB: The incident lead needs to ensure that things **are being done**, not try to do everything themselves

The incident lead can be assigned in the incident form in the #modernisation-platform-incidents channel or using the command `/modernisation-platform-incident lead @slack-handle` in the incident comms channel.

### 3.2 Scribe

**Responsibilities**:

The scribe is responsible for keeping a log of the incident, including:

* important events
* discussion topics
* decisions
* actions
* results of actions/investigations

> NB: this log is not intended to be a verbatim transcript of discussions. Rather, things like "xxx suggested the disk might be full. yyy to investigate and report back"

Entries in the log are automatically created from any Slack message pinned in the comms channel.

Key actions should be captured in the log using the `@modernisation-platform-incident action [text]` command in the dedicated comms channel.

This method should be used to record the scribe for an incident: `@modernisation-platform-incident action @slack-name-here is the scribe`

### 3.3 Communications Lead

Depending on the impact/duration/panic-level of an incident, it *may* be desirable to appoint a communications lead.

**Responsibilities**:

* communicate the incident out to those who are impacted
* decide what, how and how often to issue updates
* give updates at regular intervals
* field enquiries so the team can focus on fixing the incident without interruptions
* disseminate a post-incident report

People to update:

* Users who are affected by the problem - via #ask-modernisation-platform, #modernisation-platform-update and the affected teamâ€™s own slack channels.
* Team members for awareness or because they might be able to help - via #modernisation-platform
* People in the team who manage communication with senior leadership in MoJ - Service Owner, Delivery Manager, Product Manager

In the case of high-priority user-impacting incidents there is a need to keep the MoJ Incident Management Team aware. This is done by posting updates in the private **#p1s** slack channel (only the Service Owner and #ask-operations-engineering can do this), and via email to **[MoJdtincidentmanagement@justice.gov.uk](mailto:MoJdtincidentmanagement@justice.gov.uk)**

### Transferring roles

It may be necessary to transfer roles from one team member to another, e.g. during long-running incidents. In this case, it is the responsibility of whoever is in a role to ensure that someone else takes it over.

Whoever assumes a role should announce it in the incident slack thread, so that the team is aware.

## 4. Fix the problem

Please bear in mind that not every incident requires the whole team to be involved (even if they all *want* to join in).

## 5. End the incident

When work on the problem has ceased, either because the problem has been resolved or because resolution is blocked until a later date,
the **incident lead** should use the slack tool in the incident comms channel to close the incident:

`@modernisation-platform-incident` close

This marks the official end of the incident. If users were notified of the incident, an appropriate message should go out via the same channels
to tell them it's over.

## 6. Post-incident procedure

After the incident is resolved:

* The scribe should ensure all appropriate messages have been pinned in the comms channel, thereby adding them to the incident log
* The scribe should also ensure that any follow-up actions are recorded using the following command:
`@modernisation-platform-incident action [some text]`
* A blameless post mortem meeting should be scheduled to identify any processes that need to be improved
* A [runbook] for how to fix this issue **should** be published
