title: Changing environment (AWS account) details

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Some things we can change regarding account creation, and somethings we can't.
This document outlines what would happen if you did certain things.

## Renaming an environments json file

### Example

`environments/sprinkler.json` 

to

`environments/sprinkler-attachment.json`

### Outcome
- A new set of environments for the application `sprinkler-attachment` created as defined in the json file
- The existing `sprinkler` environment would be destroyed

(This action would fail though as AWS accounts can only be [manually deleted](deleting-an-environment.html))

### Takaway
You can't change the file name for an application.
The only way to do this theoretically is to remove the application from the Terraform state, then import it under the new name.  This has not yet been tested.

## Change the name of an environment within the environments file

### Example

```
"environments": [
  {
    "name": "development",
    "access": [
      {
        "github_slug": "modernisation-platform",
        "level": "developer"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

to

```
"environments": [
  {
    "name": "test",
    "access": [
      {
        "github_slug": "modernisation-platform",
        "level": "developer"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Outcome
- A new environment for `sandbox` created
- The existing `development` environment would be destroyed

(This action would fail though as AWS accounts can only be [manually deleted](deleting-an-environment.html))

### Takaway
You can't change the name for an environment.
The only way to do this theoretically is to remove the environment from the Terraform state, then import it under the new name.  This has not yet been tested.

## Change the github slug for an environment

### Example

```
{
  "name": "development",
  "access": [
    {
      "github_slug": "modernisation-platform",
      "level": "developer"
    }
  ]
}
```

to

```
{
  "name": "development",
  "access": [
    {
      "github_slug": "application-team",
      "level": "developer"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Outcome
- SSO would update giving the new team access and removing access for the old team
- For member accounts the github environments would be amended so that the new team is the reviewer and the old team is removed.

Note that for the github environment to be updated the new github team must first be given access to the environments repository [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/github/locals.tf#L52)

### Takaway
Changing the github slug is fine, but remember to give the team access to the environment if they don't already have it.

## Change the access level for a team in an environment

### Example

```
{
  "name": "development",
  "access": [
    {
      "github_slug": "modernisation-platform",
      "level": "developer"
    }
  ]
}
```

to

```
{
  "name": "development",
  "access": [
    {
      "github_slug": "modernisation-platform",
      "level": "administrator"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Outcome
- SSO would update giving the new access level

### Takaway
Changing the access level is fine.

## Change the tags for an application

### Example

```
"tags": {
  "application": "modernisation-platform",
  "business-unit": "Platforms",
  "owner": "Modernisation Platform: modernisation-platform@digital.justice.gov.uk"
}
```

to

```
"tags": {
  "application": "application-team",
  "business-unit": "Platforms",
  "owner": "Application Team: app-team@email-address.com"
}
```

### Outcome
- Tags for account creation will be updated with the tagging changes
- Tags for application infrastructure are generated dynamically from this data in Terraform using a data source. Any updates to the tags would be made the next time the infrastructure code for that account is run.

Note changing the business unit here is also fine as this is only used for tagging. The business unit in the environments-networking json file name and the data within that file is used for assigning networking to accounts.
### Takaway
Changing the tags is fine.
