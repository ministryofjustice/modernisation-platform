# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Private DNS zones are created in the Modernisation Platform `core-network-services` account through Terraform.
We provide `modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk` and `modernisation-platform.internal` to customers on a per-business unit basis.

This new service allows for the creation of custom private DNS zones. This has to be done in two pull requests the first one to create the zone and a second associate the zone with additional VPCs.

## Creating new private zones

New DNS zones are added in code [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-network-services/route53.tf).

Using the example code below will create the new private DNS record.

In the pull request add a name and supply the DNS name for the private zone you want to create.

#### Example

```terraform
  private-application-zones  = {
    example = "example.gov.uk"
    test    = "development.internal"
  }
}
```

## Extending the newly created private DNS zone

To extend DNS zones amend the options for the relevant `$business_unit-$environment.json` [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/environments-networks).

The new zone must be created first before adding it to the VPC options.

The below example shows the configuration needed for the association of two private zones with a VPC.

#### Example

```json
 {
  "cidr": {
    ...
  },
  "options": {
    ...
    "additional_private_zones": ["example.gov.uk", "development.internal"],
    ...
  }
}
```
