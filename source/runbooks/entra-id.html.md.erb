## What is EntraId?

EntraId (formerly Azure AD) is the Ministry of Justice enterprise identity provider used for all
justice.gov.uk accounts, email, and core applications such as Word and Excel. It manages user
identities linked to @Justice accounts, provides authentication and group-based access control, and
forms part of the core infrastructure for the Ministry of Justice.



## How the EntraId integration works

EntraId is the authoritative source for user identities and core groups. AWS IAM Identity Center
consumes those identities to grant access to AWS accounts and permission sets. The platform uses
SCIM sync jobs to reconcile EntraId and GitHub group membership into Identity Center, so access is
kept consistent across MoJ identities and platform-specific teams. This design means access changes
flow from enterprise identity through to AWS, while platform automation keeps memberships aligned.

## Why we use it
The Modernisation Platform has adopted EntraId as an identity provider for AWS account access and
management. This decision was driven by several key factors:

- Supports non-developer users and enterprise identity requirements
- Aligns access management with MoJ identity standards
- Enables consistent onboarding and offboarding across services

## Authentication and access flow

Authentication uses EntraId for MoJ identities and AWS IAM Identity Center for account access. For
more detail on logging in and the user experience, see the
[Single Sign-On guide](../concepts/environments/single-sign-on.html).

## Group and access management
Currently the management of group membership is split between GitHub and EntraId, with the intention to move towards more of a single source of truth in EntraId over time.
and as such, the current model is:

- Group membership controls access to AWS accounts and roles
- Some groups are synced automatically from GitHub teams
- EntraId group creation currently needs approval controls

Both the GitHub and EntraId groups are created outside of the Modernisation Platform. GitHub
groups can be created by anyone in the GitHub organisation. Anyone with permission to create
EntraId groups can create a new group, and it will be added to AWS as long as the group name starts
with `azure-aws-sso`. The platform's role is to consume those groups and manage access in AWS.

For more information about group permission and how groups are given permissions to AWS accounts, see the following documentation:
[Platform User Roles](source/runbooks/platform-user-roles.html)

## SCIM Lambda jobs
The platform uses two SCIM Lambda jobs to keep AWS Identity Center in sync with EntraId and GitHub:

For SCIM job schedules, secrets, troubleshooting, and manual execution steps, see the
[SCIM Lambda runbook](scim-lambda-runbook.html).
