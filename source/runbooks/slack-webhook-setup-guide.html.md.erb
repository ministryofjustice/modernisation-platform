This guide will walk you through the steps to update your environments.json file, set up a Slack webhook, and securely share the webhook URL with the Modernisation Platform team.

## Update Your environments.json File

To receive notifications when there is a change in your `environments.json` file, include the `slack-channel` key in your JSON configuration. Ensure the key reflects the actual name of your Slack channel.

### Example

```json
{
  "account-type": "member",
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "development",
      "access": [
        {
          "sso_group_name": "modernisation-platform",
          "level": "developer"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "tags": {
    "application": "example",
    "business-unit": "Platforms",
    "slack-channel": "your-slack-channel-name"
  },
  "github-oidc-team-repositories": ""
  "go-live-date": ""
}
```

Replace "your-slack-channel-name" with the actual name of your Slack channel.

## Create a Slack Webhook

If you do not already have a Slack webhook for the channel where you want to receive alerts, follow these steps:

1. **Create an App in Slack**:
   - Go to the Slack API page: [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps).
   - Click on **"Create New App"** and select **"From Scratch"**.
2. **Set Up Incoming Webhooks**:
   - Choose **"Incoming Webhooks"** from the features list.
3. **Create a Webhook for Your Channel**:
   - Scroll down to **"Webhook URLs for Your Workspace"** and click **"Add New Webhook to Workspace"**.
   - Select the Slack channel where you want to receive notifications and click **"Allow"**.
   - Copy the generated webhook URL.

## Store the Slack Webhook as a Secret

Store the Slack webhook URL securely as a secret in Secrets Manager in one of your AWS accounts managed by the Modernisation Platform.

## Create a Ticket in the Modernisation Platform Repository

To complete the setup,[create a ticket in the Modernisation Platform repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/issues/new?assignees=&labels=alerting&projects=&template=provide-slack-webhook-info.yml&title=Request+to+Integrate+Slack+Webhook+for+%3CYour+Slack+Channel+Name%3E) with the following information:

- **Name of your Slack channel**: The channel where notifications will be sent.
- **AWS account name**: The account where you have stored the webhook URL.
- **Name of the secret**: The name you used for the secret, suggested as `slack_webhook_url`.

## Regular Renewal of Slack Webhook URLs

It is recommended to renew the Slack webhook URL every 3 months to ensure security and prevent any potential misuse.

## Final Step: Confirmation and Notification

Once you have provided the above information to the Modernisation Platform team, you will start receiving notifications in the specified Slack channel whenever there is a change in the `environments.json` file.

By following these steps, you can securely set up Slack notifications for changes in your environment configuration. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact [#ask-modernisation-platform](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C01A7QK5VM1)
