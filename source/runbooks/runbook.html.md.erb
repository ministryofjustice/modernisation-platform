## Description

The Modernisation Platform is a hosting platform where Ministry of Justice teams can host and modernise applications.
It is a collection of AWS accounts, with shared networking, common security baselines and shared features such as single sign on.
For more information on the platform see the [user-guidance](../index.html) and our main [modernisation-platform](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform) GitHub repository.

## Impact of an outage

If the Modernisation Platform is down, applications hosted on the platform may not be accessible.

Issues with the following core platform services will impact users in the following ways:

Issue | Impact | Link to relevant runbook
---|---|---
core-vpc networking or RAM share failure | Networking for the accounts under the affected business unit will fail. | TBC
Transit Gateway failure | Applications will not be able to communicate with the core accounts, the NAT Gateway, other business units or the wider MoJ | TBC
GitHub or GitHub Actions failure | Users will not be able to push code or deploy to environments | TBC

## Out of hours response

For live incidents regarding the platform, we have engineers on call from 6am - 10pm Monday - Sunday.

## Consumers of this service

Applications hosted on the platform and their details can be found [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/environments). They are the "member" account types.

## Restrictions on access

Access to the AWS accounts is managed via [AWS SSO](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/environments/bootstrap/single-sign-on) for users who are part of the Ministry of Justice GitHub organisation.  External collaborators are detailed [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/collaborators.json).
If SSO fails, platform engineers can access via the [superadmin](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/modernisation-platform-account/iam.tf#L1) users.

## How to resolve specific issues

Please see the [disaster recover runbook](disaster-recovery.html) for high priority issues. For non priority tasks please see our [runbooks](../index.html#runbooks) for platform tasks or [how to guides](../index.html#how-to-guides) for user tasks.
