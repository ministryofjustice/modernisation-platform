Welcome to the team! Below is some information that you might find useful.

## General information

- Our standups are currently at 9.15am every morning
- We have our sprint retrospective every fortnight on a Monday morning
- We have our sprint planning every fornight on a Tuesday morning
- We plan our sprints through [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/projects/17)

### Team

See our [team information](../#team-information) for:

- our alliance
- our roadmap
- our vision
- who's in the team

### Your first sprint ceremonies

When you join the team, we want you to feel welcome and included. With your input, we'll collectively update our [team alliance](../team/alliance.html), and you'll be able to meet the team if you haven't done so already.

## Team tools

### Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom? Oh my!

Our main chat platform is Slack.

We use Google Meet for team calls, and use Slack for direct calls.

We rarely use Microsoft Teams or Zoom, though some all-staff meetings are held on either.

### Slack channels to join

We have three Slack channels.

#### #modernisation-platform

The [#modernisation-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C013RM6MFFW) channel is our team channel where we have team discussions about anything ranging from:

- in-depth technical issues
- our plans for the day
- to request someone else from the team's help
- when we're away for lunch
- general musings

If you can't make standup, post your standup update here.

#### #ask-modernisation-platform

The [#ask-modernisation-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01A7QK5VM1) channel is for anyone who isn't in the team to:

- ask questions about the platform
- get advice from the team

#### #modernisation-platform-notifications

The [#modernisation-platform-notifications](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01A44RL0TC) channel is where we:

- direct notifications from GitHub, such as pull requests or issues

It's a noisy channel, so it's up to you whether to join it.

### GitHub teams to join (optional)

To add or close issues in our GitHub Project, you need to join the [modernisation-platform](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/teams/modernisation-platform) team on GitHub.

The team memberships are [defined in code](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/github/modules/team/main.tf#L12). If you're comfortable doing so, please add your GitHub username there.

If you're not comfortable updating Terraform files, send a message in the [#modernisation-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C013RM6MFFW) channel and someone in the team will help you.

## Further information

We're currently building our documentation to cover core concepts and general practices within the team.

It's worth having a read through the user guide and concepts pages.

There is a varying level of technical detail across the documentation, so if you have any questions or are interested in something in particular, feel free to reach out in [#modernisation-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C013RM6MFFW).
