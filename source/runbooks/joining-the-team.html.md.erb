### Your first sprint ceremonies

When you join the team, we want you to feel welcome and included. With your input, we'll collectively update our [team alliance](../team/alliance.html), and you'll be able to meet the team if you haven't done so already.

## Team tools

### Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom? Oh my!

Our main chat platform is Slack, our fallback option is Microsoft Teams.

We use Google Meet for team calls, and use Slack for direct calls. Our fallback option is Microsoft Teams.

We rarely use Microsoft Teams or Zoom, though some all-staff meetings are held on either.

For email we use Justice Digital Google Mail, with Microsoft Justice email as a fallback option.

For development work any IDE can be used, but many team members choose Visual Studio Code
