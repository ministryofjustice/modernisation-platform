## Introduction

The Modernisation Platform shares data  with the Security Operations Cortex XSIAM application for purpose of the protective monitoring.

## Categories of data shared with Security Operations

The following data is collected for Cortex XSIAM consumption:

- `core-logging` Aggregated Cloudtrail log data from all Modernisation Platform accounts.

- `core-network-services` Network Firewall `alert` logs.

- `core-vpc-production` Route53 Resolver Query Log data. 

- `core-*` Route53 Resolver Query Log data `live_data` VPCs.

- `core-network-services` VPC Flow Log data for the `external_inspection` VPC.

- `core-vpc-production` VPC Flow Log data. 

- `core-*` VPC Flow Log data for `live_data` VPCs.

## Log delivery methods

The Cortex XSIAM application consumes data using S3 as a preferential source from the following:

- VPC Flow Log data is pulled from the `core-logging-vpc-flow-logs` S3 bucket in the `core-logging` account.
- Route 53 Resolver Query Log data is pulled from the `core-logging-r53-resolver-logs` S3 bucket in the `core-logging` account.
- Cloudtrail log data is pulled from the `modernisation-platform-logs-cloudtrail` S3 bucket in the `core-logging` account.

The Cortex XSIAM application receives Network Firewall `alert` logs by way of an Amazon Data Stream configured in the `core-network-services` account.
