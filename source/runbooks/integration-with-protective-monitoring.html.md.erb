## Introduction

The Modernisation Platform shares data with the Security Operations Cortex XSIAM application for the purpose of protective monitoring.

## Categories of data shared with Security Operations

The following data is collected for Cortex XSIAM consumption:

- **CloudTrail** logs aggregated from all Modernisation Platform accounts in the `core-logging` account

-  **Network Firewall `"Alert"` Logs** based in `core-network-services`

- **Route53 Resolver Query Logs** for `live_data` VPCs based in `core-*` accounts

- **VPC Flow Logs** 
    - for the `external_inspection` VPC  based in `core-network-services` 
    - for `live_data` VPCs based in `core-*` accounts

- **SecurityHub, GuardDuty and Inspector** findings from all MoJ AWS accounts aggregated in the `organisation-security` account 

- **Organizations** data based in the `moj-master` account

## Log delivery methods

### S3

- VPC Flow Log data is pulled from the `core-logging-vpc-flow-logs` S3 bucket in the `core-logging` account.
- Route 53 Resolver Query Log data is pulled from the `core-logging-r53-resolver-logs` S3 bucket in the `core-logging` account.
- Cloudtrail log data is pulled from the `modernisation-platform-logs-cloudtrail` S3 bucket in the `core-logging` account.

### Data Firehose
- The Cortex XSIAM application receives Network Firewall `alert` logs by way of an Amazon Data Firehose configured in the `core-network-services` account.

### IAM Users

- `XsoarIntegration` and `XsiamIntegration` IAM users based in the `moj-master` and `organisation-security` accounts to enable the [AWS Organizations](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/aws---organizations) and [AWS Security Hub Event Collector](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/aws-security-hub-event-collector) integrations

### IAM Role/CloudFormation 

- [Cloud Inventory Data](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XDR/Cortex-XDR-Documentation/Ingest-cloud-assets) is shared with Xsiam using roles deployed into each AWS account in the organization using a CloudFormation StackSet based in the `organisation-security` account
