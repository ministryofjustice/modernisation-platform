Our [Networking Diagram](../concepts/networking/networking-diagram.html) shows a high level view of how shared
VPCs are connected.

Our [Networking Approach](../concepts/networking/networking-approach.html) discusses and 
contains a detailed view of our shared VPCs.

This document discusses how these VPCs access the internet.

## Traffic from the internet

Our shared VPCs all have public subnets. Your application should have AWS load balancers (or an equivalent) in those 
subnets to receive traffic from the internet, and act as a reverse proxy to your service on the Modernisation Platform.

Public subnets have permissive Network Access Control Lists (NACLS) allowing traffic in from the internet, and route
tables attached with default routes to the internet via a VPC Internet Gateway.

## Traffic to the internet

### Shared VPCs

Our shared VPCs have private subnets and data subnets. These subnets have [restrictive NACLS](../concepts/networking/networking-approach.html#nacls)
which allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic out to the internet, and high ports in from the internet. The route tables attached 
to the private and data subnets contain a default route to the internet via a [Transit Gateway](../concepts/networking/networking-approach.html#what-we-decided-transit-gateway)
attachment.

### Transit Gateway

When VPC traffic reaches the Modernisation Platform Transit Gateway it is compared against an associated route table.
We maintain separate route tables for our `live-data` and `non-live-data` environments. Each of these route tables has a
default route pointing to a VPC in our `core-network-services` account; we maintain separate VPCs for `live-data`
environments and `non-live-data` environments.

### Core-networking VPCs

Our `core-network-services` VPCs contain [Network Firewall](../concepts/networking/network-firewall.html)
endpoints, [NAT Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html), and Internet Gateways.

Traffic enters from the Transit Gateway attachment, is routed through the Network Firewall where it is statefully 
inspected. HTTP traffic is permitted only where it matches a [defined list of domains](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-network-services/firewall-rules/fqdn_rules.json).
Permitted traffic is then routed through a NAT gateway, and from there out to the internet via the Internet Gateway.
