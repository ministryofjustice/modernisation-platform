Our [Networking Diagram](../concepts/networking/networking-diagram.html.md.erb) shows a high level view of how shared
VPCs are connected.

Our [Networking Approach](../concepts/networking/networking-approach.html.md.erb) discusses and 
contains a detailed view of our shared VPCs.

This document discusses how these VPCs access the internet.

## Traffic from the internet

Our shared VPCs all have public subnets. Your application should have AWS load balancers (or an equivalent) in those 
subnets to receive traffic from the internet, and act as a reverse proxy to your service on the Modernisation Platform.

Public subnets have permissive Network Access Control Lists (NACLS) allowing traffic in from the internet, and route tables
attached with default routes to the internet via a VPC Internet Gateway.

### Shared VPCs

Our shared VPCs have private subnets and data subnets. These subnets have [restrictive NACLS]([Networking Approach](../concepts/networking/networking-approach.html.md.erb))
