# YJAF AWS Account Password Resets

From time to time we may get requests to the Modernisation Platform mailbox for Youth Justice Application Framework (YJAF) AWS IAM account resets.

This is a manual process that is managed via the console.

## Steps to reset password

1. Access the **Youth Justice Framework Management AWS account** via [SSO](https://moj.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts).
2. Go to the IAM Console.
3. Click on `Users` tab.
4. Click on the user name that requires a password reset.
5. Click on the `Security Credentials` tab
6. Click on the `Manage console access` button
7. Select the `Reset Password` option
8. Check that `Autogenerated password` is selected and tick the `User must create new password at next sign-in`
9. Click on the `Reset Password` button to generate a new password
10. Copy the autogenerated password and email it to the user
