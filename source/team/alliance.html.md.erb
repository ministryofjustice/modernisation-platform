As a team, we regularly discuss and decide on our alliance, and document these openly and publicly.

Our alliance is as follows (in alphabetical order):

- We agree that it is important for us to all learn
- We agree that it is ok for us to make mistakes
- We agree that it is ok to respectfully challenge and debate each other
- We agree that no question is a stupid question
- We will aim to communicate more than necessary in our Slack team channel
- We will be transparent, open and inclusive
- We will call each other out when we break our principles
- We will highlight achievements
- We will hold a fortnightly remote social activity (skribblio every other social)
- We will lead a blameless culture
- We will regularly introspect and adapt
- We will share and actively engage with other teams
- We will stop start starting and start finishing
- We won't take ourselves too seriously
