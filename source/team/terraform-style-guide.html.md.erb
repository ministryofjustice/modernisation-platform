## Modernisation Platform Terraform Style Guide

> This style guide is meant to be a series of guidelines to help Modernisation Platform team members produce
> consistent, coherent Terraform. These guidelines **aren't** meant to restrict or constrain you. Hashicorp maintain a
> style guide [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/style) which provides us with a good starting
> point.

> First, and foremost, try and stay consistent with what you find in a repository. The same approach - even if it's not
> the best approach - is easier to understand than multiple different approaches.

## Naming

Naming things is hard. We want naming structures to be consistent, and we want names to help explain what we're working
with.

- Use lower case characters
- Use underscores as separators
- Keep names comprehensible

### Examples

✅ lower cased, underscored, comprehensible

> `resource "an_example" "this_looks_good" {}`

❌ mixed case, no separation or inconsistent separation, no clear purpose

> `resource "another_example" "SemaphoreCricketBrick-a-brack" {}`

## Hard-coding values

Hard-coding values can be unavoidable, but we want to be judicious about hard-coding things. We want our Terraform to be
flexible and idempotent, and hard-coding things can work against this.

- Keep this to a minimum
- Ensure these aren't sensitive values
- Retrieve values from an external source or local value

### Examples

✅ loads values in through an external file

> ```hcl
> locals {
>   example_values    = jsondecode(./my-values.json)
> }
> resource "an_example" "hard_coded_values" {
>   name              = local.example_values["application-name"]
>   number_of_pickles = local.example_values["pickle-capacity"]
>   password          = "set-me-in-the-console" # set this in the console
> }
> ```

❌holds values in-line, displays sensitive value

> ```hcl
> resource "another_example" "hard_coded_values" {
>   name              = "pickle-counter"
>   number_of_pickles = "3" # because production needs three, we'll give all environments 3
>   password          = "MyPickles1"
> }
> ```

## Local values

We make heavy use of local values. We use local values compute things at runtime, and create data structures that then
let us do more challenging or complicated things.

- Think about where your locals will sit as you add them
  - `locals.tf` for locals used in multiple places
  - `locals {}` in a single file for values used only in one place
- Be judicious about using local values
- Explain them if they're difficult to understand

### Examples

✅ clear, explains what the secondary map does, avoids overcomplexity

> ```hcl
> locals {
>   my-files   = {
>     for f in fileset(path.module, "my-files/*.json") :
>     trimsuffix(basename(f), ".json") => jsondecode(file("${path.module}/${f}"))
>   }
>   # constructs a map based on json file names that contains names and favourite hotdog style
>   my-hotdogs = {
>     for key, value in local.my-files :
>       key => {
>         name   = value["name"]
>         hotdog = value["favourite-hotdog"]
>      }
>    }
> }
> ```

❌ horribly complex and unhelpful, lots of type conversions, cryptic names

> ```hcl
> locals {
>  _x = { for i in flatten([for f in local.files : regexall("^(.+?).json$", f)]) :
>    replace(element(i, 0), "/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/", "_") =>
>    try(jsondecode(file(coalesce("${path.module}/${i[0]}", "null.json"))), {})
>  }
> }
> ```

## Data sources

Data sources allow the retrieval of values from resources not directly managed in code. We have no set structure for
where data sources ought to live. A specified file such as `data.tf` is a sensible location, but as code scales then
keeping the data sources close to the code that requires them is desirable.

- Prefer outputs from resources over data sources
- Prefer outputs from modules over data sources
- Be sparing in the use of [external](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/external/latest/docs/data-sources/external) data sources

## Modules

Terraform modules allow us to produce reusable blocks of code. If the need is specific to one repository consider the
use of a smaller, in-line approach. When the need is more complicated, or has multiple potential customers consider the
use of a separate repository.

We have two approaches for our use of modules.

- Large modules
  - 100s of lines of Terraform
  - Complex (eg, with sub-modules)
  - Separated out into their own repositories
  - Non-modernisation-platform users like application teams deploying to MP
  - Unit tested
- Small modules
  - 10s of lines of Terraform
  - Single purpose (eg, re-tagging RAM shared resources)
  - Used inside a repository

## Examples

✅ Large modules

- [modernisation-platform-oidc-role](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-github-oidc-role)
- [modernisation-platform-terraform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-environments)

✅ Small modules

- Baselines [config](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-baselines/tree/main/modules/config) module
- GitHub [contributor](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/github/modules/contributor) access module
