## Work and tasks management

[GitHub projects](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/projects/17) are used to manage our workload.
We use a scrum board to help us visualise the work delivery progress and we work in two week sprints to deliver milestones.

The board allows a task to be in one of four stages. When a ticket is read to work on, it will be displayed under `To Do` stage column.
When a ticket gets picked up by a team member it gets assigned to that team member and it is moved to the `In Progress` stage.
When the ticket gets implemented and tested, it is further moved the `Done` stage.

Occasionally there are situations that work on a ticket gets blocked, the `Blocked` stage is for such occasions.

As a team we have agreed to do the following for each stage:
* `To Do`
** Tasks are roughly prioritised during a sprint planning session, but we are not obliged to take the one from the top.
We have the freedom of picking a task that we want to work on and we do not pre-assign team members to a task prior the start of a sprint.
** Tasks that are selected for a sprint should have all the necessary information in the task description, including a Definition of Done (DoD).
If it is not clear what is asked in the task, it does not meet the Definition of Ready (DoR) and should be taken out of the sprint.

* `In Progress`
** Adding progress notes to a task as we reach a milestone rather than daily updates.
** Including links to PRs, information about tests (if not part of the PR workflow) and other useful references in the task comments.
** When a task takes longer to complete than initially expected it is up to an individual to raise it with a team to get some help or to break down the task.
** We all should take part in reviewing tasks.

* `Blocked`
** If you suspect that a task will be blocked for the whole sprint, take it out of the sprint.

* `Done`
** Tasks can be closed when they have been implemented, tested and reviewed.
** Closing an issue moves a task to `Done`, where moving an issue to `Done` does not close it, hence close it, rather than move it.
