## Overview

A selection of [AWS VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-privatelink/what-are-vpc-endpoints.html) are supplied by default to member VPCs.

Modernisation Platform customers can raise pull requests to add further VPC endpoints as they require them.

## Default AWS VPC Endpoints

Modernisation Platform `core-vpc-*` accounts contain per-business-unit VPCs which each have the following endpoints provisioned in their `protected` subnets:

```
"com.amazonaws.eu-west-2.ec2",
"com.amazonaws.eu-west-2.ec2messages",
"com.amazonaws.eu-west-2.ssm",
"com.amazonaws.eu-west-2.ssmmessages",
```

No action is required to make use of these.

## Adding supplementary AWS VPC Endpoints

Additional VPC endpoints should be defined in the relevant `$business_unit-$environment.json` file in our [environments-networks](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/environments-networks) directory.
You can raise a pull request similar to [this example](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/pull/7408) for any additions you require.

```
{
  ...
  "options": {
    ...
    "additional_endpoints": [
      "com.amazonaws.eu-west-2.$endpoint"
    ],
    ...
  }
}
```

## Validating the creation of supplementary AWS VPC Endpoints

Changes to VPC endpoints will be made through GitHub Actions. You can track the relevant `core-vpc-*` workflow [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/actions).

You can also follow our guidance on [Viewing Core Account resources as a Member Account Developer](./member-read-only-core-accounts.html) to review the VPC endpoints in the relevant `core-vpc-*` account.
