## What we don't offer

We don't offer the following, although we can help advise if you need it:

- application related support, including responding to application specific alerts or failures, unless it is caused by the Modernisation Platform
- any support for custom infrastructure or other tools deployed by yourselves that isn't managed by the Modernisation Platform
- application security
- ongoing maintenance of the application, including patching the application, updating dependencies, and ensuring it remains deployable
- user support for applications
- alternative ways for end users to access applications that aren't accessible either over the internet or via existing MOJ networks

## What we expect from application teams

We expect application teams to:

- monitor and manage the health of their applications and application-specific infrastructure, such as monitoring, logging, and alerts, as appropriate
- keep their applications and application-specific infrastructure appropriately patched, up to date, and secure
- ensure applications remain deployable end-to-end from their source code
- regularly assess whether the service is still meeting user needs, and make appropriate efforts to improve, replace or decommission the service if not
- provide their own specialist skills, such as DBAs, in their own teams, if required
