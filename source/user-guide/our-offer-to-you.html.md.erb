## What we're exploring support for in the future

Please see our [roadmap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10KdJ5cKKJTp3AcH3aS9hE-WkwjWTu8o30WpxONczlG4/edit#slide=id.p) for what we are exploring in the future.
A full list of issues and stories are in our [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/projects/17/views/1).

If there is a feature you would like to see on the Modernisation Platform, please add it as a new story in our backlog [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=story-template.md)

## What we don't offer

We don't offer the following, although we can help advise if you need it:

- application related support, including responding to application specific alerts or failures, unless it is caused by the Modernisation Platform
- support and maintenance of application infrastructure
- support for tools deployed by yourselves that aren't managed by the Modernisation Platform
- application security
- ongoing maintenance of the application, including patching the application, updating dependencies, and ensuring it remains deployable
- user support for applications
- alternative ways for end users to access applications that aren't accessible either over the internet or via existing MOJ networks

## What we expect from application teams

We expect application teams to:

- monitor and manage the health of their applications and application infrastructure, such as monitoring, logging, and alerts, as appropriate
- keep their applications and application infrastructure appropriately patched, up to date, and secure
- ensure applications remain deployable end-to-end from their source code
- regularly assess whether the service is still meeting user needs, and make appropriate efforts to improve, replace or decommission the service if not
- provide their own specialist skills, such as DBAs, in their own teams, if required
- maintain their application Github teams and remove users when they leave or no longer require access
