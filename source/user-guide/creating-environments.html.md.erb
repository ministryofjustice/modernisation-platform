## Overview

In the Modernisation Platform, we define environments (AWS accounts) via a JSON file in the [environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/environments) directory of the [Modernisation Platform repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform).


When we recieve your request we will create a new JSON file and submit a pull request to the Modernisation Platform repository. On merging the Modernisation Platform will automatically provision your environments. Each environment defined represents an AWS account, see the [example](#blank-example) below for more information.

## Requesting an environment

To request a new environment, simply [create an issue](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/issues/new/choose) using the `New Modernisation Platform Environment` template. 

This will ask you for the following information:

### Application name

Please follow MoJ guidance for [naming things](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/documentation/standards/naming-things.html#naming-things)

### Github team slug

This is the name of your Github team that will be accessing the environment. Environments are accessed via single sign on (SSO), so to give people permissions to access your environment you just have to add them to your Github team.

### Environments

Which environments you wish to use, we provide [core networking](creating-networking.html) for up to 4 accounts as standard.
Usually two environments per application will be enough, a production account and a non production account.

* development
* test
* preproduction
* production

As these environments are identical, and controlled via code, we would recommend you try to use as few environments as possible. We can provide more environments if there is a genuine need for them.

### Tags

These will be used to tag your AWS resources, for further guidance on tagging please see [here](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/documentation/standards/documenting-infrastructure-owners.html#tags-you-should-use)

The is-production tag will be inferred if the environment is production.

tag | value
--- | ---
application | Find a solicitor
business-unit | LAA
owner | find-a-solicitor@ministryofjustice.gov.uk

Valid business-unit values
HQ,HMPPS,OPG,LAA,HMCTS,CICA,Platforms,CJSE,Probation

### Additional features

In addition to the core networking provided, you can request bastion access, additional VPC endpoints and extended DNS zones.

See [creating networking](creating-networking.html) for more information on additional features.

### Architecture

You can view our architecture for Environments (AWS accounts) on the [dedicated Environments (AWS accounts) architecture page](../concepts/environments/architecture.html), which also explains what you get by doing this.

## Example JSON files

Here are some exmaples of the environments JSON file that the Modernisation Platform team will create.

### Schema
- `account-type` determines if this is a core modernisation platform account or a user member account
- `environments` should be an array of objects for environments required. If the environment is `production`, retention periods, backup frequency, and similar will be different compared to non-production environments
- the `name` key and `access` object are required, see: [Another example](#another-example)
- `tags` should be an object of the mandatory tags defined in the MoJ [Tagging Guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/documentation/standards/documenting-infrastructure-owners.html#tagging-your-infrastructure). You can omit `is-production` as we infer this from the environment name

### Blank example

`filename`: `application-name.json`

```json
{
  "account-type": "",
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": ""
      "access": {
        "github_slug": "",
        "access": ""
      }
    }
  ],
  "tags": {
    "application": "",
    "business-unit": "",
    "owner": ""
  }
}
```

### Another example

An JSON definition for an nonsensical application called [`glados`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLaDOS), that needs two environments: `development` and `production`, and want to give the GitHub team `glados-team` access to each environment.

`filename`: `glados.json`

```json
{
  "account-type": "member",
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "development",
      "access": {
        "github_slug": "glados-team",
        "access": "application-team"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "production",
      "access": {
        "github_slug": "glados-team",
        "access": "developer"
      }
    }
  ],
  "tags": {
    "application": "GLaDOS",
    "business-unit": "Platforms",
    "owner": "GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System): aperture-science@digital.justice.gov.uk"
  }
}
```

This will provision two AWS accounts, which will be called: `glados-non-production`, and `glados-production`.
