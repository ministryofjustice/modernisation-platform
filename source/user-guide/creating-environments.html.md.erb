## Overview

In the Modernisation Platform, we define environments (AWS accounts) via a JSON file in the [environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/environments) directory of the [Modernisation Platform repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform).

When we recieve your request we will create a new JSON file and submit a pull request to the Modernisation Platform repository. On merging the Modernisation Platform will automatically provision your environments. Each environment defined represents an AWS account, see the [example](#blank-example) below for more information.

## Requesting an environment

To request a new environment, simply [create an issue](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/issues/new/choose) using the `New Modernisation Platform Environment` template.

This will ask you for the following information:

### Application name

Please follow MoJ guidance for [naming things](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/documentation/standards/naming-things.html#naming-things)
The name must be in lowercase and a maximum of 30 characters. If you need to use a separater use `-`.

### GitHub team slug

This is the name of your GitHub team that will be accessing the environment. Environments are accessed via single sign on (SSO), so to give people permissions to access your environment you just have to add them to your GitHub team.

Users who are not part of the MoJ GitHub organisation will need to be added as collaborators separately once the account has been created.  Please contact the Modernisation Platform team to do this.

If you wish to add additional deployment reviewers from outside your GitHub team you can specfiy these per an environment in the application.json file (See: "additional_reviewers" in [Another example](#another-example) for an example).

### GitHub "codeowner" team slug

By default members of the github team/s specified can both access the aws environments which are created and approve PRs to release changes in to these environemnts.

If required you can seperate the permissions so that a different github team acts as a "codeowner", this way PRs can require a review from this team before changes are released.

### Access

This is the level of access for the GitHub team to the Modernisation Platform.
A full list of permissions for the different access levels can be found [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/bootstrap/delegate-access/policies.tf)
The options are as follows:

#### view-only

 - Log into the console
 - See resources and basic metadata. You cannot see the content of resources such as logs or S3 buckets.

#### read-only

- Log into the console
- Comprehensive read-only visibility of the AWS environment. As this role provides access to contents of S3 and others, it is designed for users for whom view-only is insufficient.
- Role makes use of AWS ReadOnly managed policy and is not at present configurable beyond that.

#### developer

 - Log into the console
 - Read only access to resources including things like logs and S3 buckets
 - View and Edit [Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) secrets and [Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) values
 - Create and rotate access keys for the application deployment CI user
 - [Connect to instances via SSM](accessing-ec2s.html)
 - Start, stop and reboot EC2 instances
 - Create and copy Snapshots
 - Put and delete S3 objects
 - [Import certificates to ACM](certificate-import.html)
 - [Switch roles to view shared resources](member-read-only-core-accounts.html)
 - Raise AWS Support cases

#### sandbox

The sandbox access can only be used on a `development` environment account.

- Log into the console
- Same console read and write permissions as the pipelines have
- This permission can only be attached to development accounts
- Once a week the account will be cleared with [AWS Nuke](../concepts/environments/auto-nuke.html) then rebuilt from Terraform

The idea of sandbox access is that it gives you freedom to experiment and modify things in the console to assist with creating your Terraform code.

Anything not in code will be lost at the end of the week.

#### migration

The migration role is a temporary role, given to assist with AWS managed migration services

- Log into the console
- Developer permissions
- Permissions to use [AWS Migration services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/migration-services.html)

Once the migration is complete for an environment this role should be removed.

#### instance-management

The instance-management role is a role given to assist database administrators.

- Log into the console
- Read only access to resources including things like logs and S3 buckets
- Start, stop and reboot EC2 instances
- Create and copy Snapshots
- [Connect to instances via SSM](accessing-ec2s.html)
- Active Directory permissions

#### security-audit

- Log into the console
- See resources and metadata useful to security operations teams and security audit teams
- Makes use of AWS managed SecurityAudit policy

#### reporting-operations

- DMS Start, stop
- SQL Workbench
- Athena
- Glue
- Redshift

#### data-engineering

Created for data engineers to have developer permissions as well as glue and athena permissions all in one policy. 

- Log into the console.
- Data engineering permissions.

#### administrator

 - Full admin access

This is a legacy role and will not be generally available.

### Environment name

Which environments you wish to use, we provide [core networking](creating-networking.html) for up to 4 accounts as standard.
Usually two environments per application will be enough, a production account and a development account.

* development
* test
* preproduction
* production

As these environments are identical, and controlled via code, we would recommend you try to use as few environments as possible. We can provide more environments if there is a genuine need for them.

### Tags

These will be used to tag your AWS resources, for further guidance on tagging please see [here](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/documentation/standards/documenting-infrastructure-owners.html#tags-you-should-use)

The is-production tag will be inferred if the environment is production.

tag | value
--- | ---
application | Find a solicitor
business-unit | LAA
owner | find-a-solicitor@ministryofjustice.gov.uk

Valid business-unit values
HQ,HMPPS,OPG,LAA,HMCTS,CICA,Platforms,CJSE

### Additional features

In addition to the core networking provided, you can request bastion access, additional VPC endpoints and extended DNS zones.

See [creating networking](creating-networking.html) for more information on additional features.

### Architecture

You can view our architecture for Environments (AWS accounts) on the [dedicated Environments (AWS accounts) architecture page](../concepts/environments/architecture.html), which also explains what you get by doing this.

## Example JSON files

Here are some examples of the environments JSON file that the Modernisation Platform team will create.

### Schema
- `account-type` determines if this is a core modernisation platform account or a user member account
- `environments` should be an array of objects for environments required. If the environment is `production`, retention periods, backup frequency, and similar will be different compared to non-production environments
- `codeowners` is an optional list of github slugs if you want specific teams to review code changes before they are released to environments 
- the `name` key and `access` object are required, see: [Another example](#another-example)
- the `nuke` key is optional and is only read if the `access.level` is `sandbox`
- `tags` should be an object of the mandatory tags defined in the MoJ [Tagging Guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/documentation/standards/documenting-infrastructure-owners.html#tagging-your-infrastructure). You can omit `is-production` as we infer this from the environment name

### Blank example

`filename`: `application-name.json`

```json
{
  "account-type": "",
  "codeowners": [""],
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": ""
      "access": [
        {
          "github_slug": "",
          "level": "",
          "nuke": ""
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "tags": {
    "application": "",
    "business-unit": "",
    "infrastructure-support": "",
    "owner": ""
  },
  "github-oidc-team-repositories": [""],
  "go-live-date": ""
}
```

### Another example

An JSON definition for an nonsensical application called [`glados`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLaDOS), that needs two environments: `development` with `sandbox` permissions and `production`, and want to give the GitHub team `glados-team` access to each environment. If a develoment account with sandbox permissions has no `nuke` key defined, it will automatically be [wiped on a weekly basis](../concepts/environments/auto-nuke.html). The `nuke` value of `rebuild` indicates that the development account will be automatically rebuilt from code after it is nuked.

`filename`: `glados.json`

```json
{
  "account-type": "member",
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "development",
      "access": [
        {
        "github_slug": "glados-team",
        "level": "sandbox",
        "nuke": "rebuild"
        }
      ],
      "additional_reviewers": ["GitHubUsername1" , "GitHubUsername2"]
    },
    {
      "name": "production",
      "access": [
        {
          "github_slug": "glados-team",
          "level": "view-only"
        }
      ],
      "additional_reviewers": ["GitHubUsername3" , "GitHubUsername4"]
    }
  ],
  "tags": {
    "application": "GLaDOS",
    "business-unit": "Platforms",
    "infrastructure-support": "",
    "owner": "GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System): aperture-science@digital.justice.gov.uk"
  },
  "github-oidc-team-repositories": [""],
  "go-live-date": ""
}
```

This will provision two AWS accounts, which will be called: `glados-development`, and `glados-production`.
