## Introduction

You can create a shared [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) in the Modernisation Platform to store your [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container images.

The ECR can then be shared to all of your application accounts.

## Steps

1. Clone the [modernisation-platform](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/) GitHub repository.
1. Add your ECR registry to a **Terraform file** in [terraform/environments/core-shared-services/](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/environments/core-shared-services)
    - Check if a Terraform file already exists for your application in [terraform/environments/core-shared-services/](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/environments/core-shared-services)
    - If it does not exist, create a new file
    - If it already exists, use the existing file
    - The file **must be named after your application** and match the name defined in the [environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/environments) configuration
1. You will need to specify the `push_principals` (who do you want to be able to upload to the ECR) and `pull_principals` (who do you want to be able to download from the ECR)
1. Raise a pull request
1. The pull request will require approval from the team associated with the Terraform file, as defined in the [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) configuration. Once the relevant team approves, the pull request can be merged.
