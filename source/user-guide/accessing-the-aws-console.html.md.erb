You can view your infrastructure via the AWS console, you will also need access to the AWS console to create and configure your [AWS Credentials (access keys)](configuring-aws-credentials.html)

## Logging in

Logging in to the AWS console is done via single sign on.  As part of the environment creation, you would have provided the name of a team in Github. Any member of this team will have access to the environment.

Click on the single sign on url - [https://moj.awsapps.com/start](https://moj.awsapps.com/start)

You will see the single sign on screen, click on `Continue with GitHub` and sign in with Github to continue.
