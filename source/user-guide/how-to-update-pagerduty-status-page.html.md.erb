## Introduction

If there is an incident or planned maintenance affecting the Modernisation Platform, you will need to update the [external status page](https://status.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/). This guide explains how to do that.

## Creating and Updating Status Changes

You can create or update incident and maintenance statuses in two ways:

1. **Via Slack**:  
   Use the PagerDuty incident creation app by typing the `/pd` command in Slack.  
   For more details, see the [incident process documentation](../runbooks/manage-an-incident.html#2-declare-the-incident).

2. **Via the PagerDuty Web Interface**:  
   There are two steps to using PagerDuty directly:

   **Step 1 – Create the incident:**

   - Log in to the [PagerDuty site](https://moj-digital-tools.pagerduty.com/).
   - Navigate to **Incidents** > **New Incident**.
   - Complete the following fields:
     - **Title** – A brief summary of the issue.
     - **Service** – Select “Modernisation Platform” or the appropriate service.
     - **Urgency** – Choose `High` or `Low` based on severity.
     - **Assign to** – Pick the relevant escalation policy or person.
     - **Description** – Add detailed context about the issue.
   - Click **Create Incident**.

   **Step 2 – Update the external status page:**

   - Hover over the _“Status”_ menu and select _“External Status Page”_.
   - Click on _“Ministry of Justice Modernisation Platform”_.
   - You’ll see the newly created incident listed in the **Pending Approvals** section.
   - Click on the incident and review the status page form:
     - Confirm the **incident status**, **title**, and **description**.
     - Ensure the **business service**, **impact level**, and **next update time** are correct.
   - Click **Post** to submit for approval.

3. **What happens next – Pending Approval**:  
   After submission, the incident stays in the **Pending Approvals** area until an authorised user reviews and publishes it (dont forget this step, anyone in the team can approve if they are on PagerDuty).  
   Once approved, it goes live on the external status page and becomes visible to subscribers.

## Approving Status Changes

After an incident has been submitted, it will appear in the **Pending Approvals** section of the external status page.

Approvers are notified by email and must:

- Log in to PagerDuty.
- Navigate to the external status page.
- Review the pending incident details.
- If everything is correct, click **Publish** to make the incident live.

Once published, the incident will appear publicly, and users can subscribe for updates.

## Subscribing to Status Updates

During an incident, users can subscribe for email updates on that specific incident. Alternatively, they can:

- Subscribe to the entire status page to receive updates on all services.
- Choose to follow specific business services of interest.

This ensures stakeholders stay informed about any ongoing or future issues.
