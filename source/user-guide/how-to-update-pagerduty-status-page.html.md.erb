## Introduction

If there is an incident or planned maintenance affecting the Modernisation Platform, you will need to update the [external status page](https://status.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/). This guide explains how to do that.

## Creating and Updating Status Changes

You can create or update incident and maintenance statuses in two ways:

1. **Via Slack**:  
   Use the PagerDuty incident creation app by typing the `/pd` command in Slack.  
   For more details, see the [incident process documentation](../runbooks/manage-an-incident.html#2-declare-the-incident).

2. **Via the PagerDuty Web Interface**:  
   There are two steps to using PagerDuty directly:  

   **Step 1 – Create the incident:**
   - Log in to the [PagerDuty site](https://moj-digital-tools.pagerduty.com/).
   - Navigate to **Incidents** > **New Incident**.
   - Complete the following fields:
     - **Title** – A brief summary of the issue.
     - **Service** – Select “Modernisation Platform” or the appropriate service.
     - **Urgency** – Choose `High` or `Low` based on severity.
     - **Assign to** – Pick the relevant escalation policy or person.
     - **Description** – Add detailed context about the issue.
   - Click **Create Incident**.

   **Step 2 – Update the external status page:**
   - Hover over the _“Status”_ menu and select _“External Status Page”_.
   - Click on _“Ministry of Justice Modernisation Platform”_.
   - You’ll see the newly created incident listed in the **Pending Approvals** section.
   - Click on the incident and review the status page form:
     - Confirm the **incident status**, **title**, and **description**.
     - Ensure the **business service**, **impact level**, and **next update time** are correct.
   - Click **Post** to submit for approval.

3. **What happens next – Pending Approval**:  
   After submission, the incident stays in the **Pending Approvals** area until an authorised user reviews and publishes it.  
   Once approved, it goes live on the external status page and becomes visible to subscribers.

## Approving Status Changes

After an incident has been submitted, it will appear in the **Pending Approvals** section of the external status page.

Approvers are notified by email and must:

- Log in to PagerDuty.
- Navigate to the external status page.
- Review the pending incident details.
- If everything is correct, click **Publish** to make the incident live.

Once published, the incident will appear publicly, and users can subscribe for updates.

## Subscribing to Status Updates

During an incident, users can subscribe for email updates on that specific incident. Alternatively, they can:

- Subscribe to the entire status page to receive updates on all services.
- Choose to follow specific business services of interest.

This ensures stakeholders stay informed about any ongoing or future issues.
