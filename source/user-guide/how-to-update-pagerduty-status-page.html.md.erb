## Introduction
If there is an incident or planned maintenance you will need to update the external status page for the modernisation platform [modernisation platform status page](https://status.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) this guide will show you how to do this.

### Manually creating and updating status changes
Incidents and maintenance window status can be created and updated in two ways, the first way is by logging on to the PagerDuty site and the other is by using the PugerDuty incident creation app within slack via the /pd command.
More information on how to raise an incident via slack is avalible on the incident process page [here](../runbooks/manage-an-incident.html#2-declare-the-incident)

The other way you change the status on the status page is by logging in to the pager duty site via the following [Link](https://moj-digital-tools.pagerduty.com/). Once logged in hover over the status menu option at the top right of the page then click on external status.
When this page loads there will be two options to choose from, click on the Modernisation Platform, from here you can click on post new incident, and will be presented with a form to fill in.

On the form you will need to select the incident status add an incident title and also a description, once you have done that you will also need to select which business service is impacted and also the impact to that service. The last item that needs to be selected is the amount of time until the next update, if you are happy with the information inputted click on the Post button.

This will then need to be approved before the status page is updated.

### Approving status changes

Approvers will be notified of the new incident once it has been raised by email, approvers will then need to log in to PagerDuty to review the incident.  Once they are happy they can click on the publish button and the incident page will be updated.

The status page will be updated automatically upon the pressing of the publish button and users will then be able to subscribe for updates.
### Subscribing to the status page

In the event of an incident you can subscribe to the incident for email updates additionally you can also subscribe to the whole page if you want to be informed of future updates.
You can also chose to follow just one of the business services or all of them.
