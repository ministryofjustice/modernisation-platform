# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This section describes how access keys for **superadmins** and **collaborators** are managed:

### Superadmin Users

If a superadmin user's access keys have never been used, or if they have not been used within the last 30 days, the access keys will be automatically deleted.

### Collaborator Users

Similarly, if a collaborator's access keys have never been used, or if they have not been used within the last 90 days, the collaborator's access keys will be deleted.

### Automated Process

An automated process runs every Monday at 7:30 AM to manage and delete unused access keys according to the criteria outlined for superadmin and collaborator users.

### Regaining Access After Key Deletion

If your access keys have been deleted and you need to regain access, you will need to create new access keys. Follow the standard process to generate and configure new keys.
