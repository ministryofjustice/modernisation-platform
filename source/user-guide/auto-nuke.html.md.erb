## Auto-nuke and redeploy development environments on weekly basis

This feature automatically nukes and recreates development environments on weekly basis. This is useful for environments with the sandbox permission, which allow users provisioning resources directly through the AWS web console as opposite to using terraform. In such cases, the auto-nuke will make sure the resources created manually will be cleared on weekly basis and only the ones created through terraform will be redeployed.

Every Sunday:

- At 10.00pm the nuke.yml job is triggered. This job nukes all the configured development environments using the AWS Nuke tool (https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke).
- At 12.00 noon the nuke-redeploy.yml job is triggered. This job redeploys all the nuked environments using terraform apply.

Configuration through env variables:

- NUKE_ACCOUNT_IDS: JSON string of account IDs. For example,
```
NUKE_ACCOUNT_IDS='
{
  "NUKE_ACCOUNT_IDS": {
    "SPRINKLER_DEVELOPMENT_ACCID": "111111111111",
    "COOKER_DEVELOPMENT_ACCID": "222222222222",
    "PERFORMANCE_HUB_DEVELOPMENT_ACCID": "333333333333"
  }
}'
```
- NUKE_SKIP_ENVIRONMENTS: A comma-separated list of directories or terraform workspaces to skip from nuking. For example, `NUKE_SKIP_ENVIRONMENTS=nomis,xhibit-portal-development,equip-development,tariff-development,`. As can be observed in the example, every directory or terraform workspace needs a leading comma, hence the last comma in the list.
- NUKE_DO_NOT_RECREATE_ENVIRONMENTS: A comma-separated list of directories or terraform workspaces to skip from recreating through terraform after nuking. For example, `NUKE_DO_NOT_RECREATE_ENVIRONMENTS=performance-hub-development,example-development,sample-development,`.

The `nuke-config-template.txt` holds the nuke configuration YAML with account IDs being abstracted away by variables. For example, during the actual execution, `$PERFORMANCE_HUB_DEVELOPMENT_ACCID` will be replaced by the corresponding account ID for performance-hub-development. That is because account IDs is sensitive data and cannot be committed into code. Notice the naming convention, which is important, where `performance-hub-development` account name and terraform workspace is matched to the variable `$PERFORMANCE_HUB_DEVELOPMENT_ACCID`. The account ID variable is derived from the account name converted to upper case, hyphens replaced by underscored, and suffixed by `_ACCID`.

A sketch of the algorithm is as follows:

- For every directory under `terraform/environments`
- Find the account ID for the development account
- Assume the role MemberInfrastructureAccess under the account ID
- Nuke the resources under the account ID
- Perform terraform apply in order to recreate all resources from terraform

When a new development environment is onboarded into the Modernisation Platform, we need to manually add the new account ID to:

- The repository secret `NUKE_ACCOUNT_IDS` of the envrionments repository: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/settings/secrets/actions Refer to the above documentation of NUKE_ACCOUNT_IDS for the format of the value.
- The `accounts:` section inside `nuke-config-template.txt`.

If either of the above is missed then the `nuke.yml` job will fail with a relevant error.
