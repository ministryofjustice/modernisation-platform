## Introduction

GitHub Advanced Security’s **Secret Scanning** features enables users to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities in their infrastructure source code by automatically detecting accidental exposure of secrets such as credentials, API keys, or tokens.

We have enabled general access to this feature in the [modernisation-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments) repository for all GitHub users within the `ministryofjustice` organisation via the `all-org-users` team.  

We strongly encourage teams to regularly review and address any security alerts raised against their source code in this repository.  

## Identifying Vulnerabilities using Secret Scanning

- Access the Security dashboard for the Environments repository - https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/security
- There are two options for Secret Scanning:

    - Default: These are partner-validated patterns built into GitHub cover well-known providers such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Slack, Stripe, Twilio, etc. As these alerts are maintained by Github they cannot be modified.
    - Generic: These are heuristic patterns that detect common secret formats even if they don’t belong to a specific provider. Examples include:

        - Long random alphanumeric strings.
        - Base64-encoded tokens.
        - Private keys (e.g., -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----).

## Reviewing Secret Scanning Alerts

Each secret scanning alert contains the following information:

  - Type (e.g. AWS key, GitHub token).
  - Location (branch, commit, or file where the secret was detected) and the Github account associated with the author.
  - Severity (High by default, as all secrets are sensitive).
  - First detected and last updated timestamps.
  - Status (Open, Closed as fixed, Closed as false positive, or Revoked).

When reviewing secret scanning alerts it is suggested that the following is assessed:

  - Is the secret current and in use?
  - Does the secret relate to production infrastructure or applications? 
  - Are the processes for rotating or retiring the secret from us understood?
  - In the event that an alert for a production secret is found, what processes are to be followed such as incident reporting.

We do suggest contacting the Modernisation Platform team should you have any questions regarding an alert.

Further information on the use of Secret Scanning can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-secret-scanning)


## Searching for Vulnerabilities using Code Scanning

In addition to Secret Scanning, Github also generates alerts for issues and vulnerabilities through the use of static application security testing (SAST) tools. These include trivy, checkov, tflint etc.

- Access the Code Scanning dashboard [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning).  
- By default, results are filtered with `is:open branch:main`, showing only open alerts for the `main` branch.  
- To filter by a specific environment, use the `path` option. For example:  
  `path:terraform/environments/sprinkler` will display alerts for the *sprinkler* environment.  
- To filter by severity, use the `severity` option. For example:  
  `severity:critical`.  

Full documentation on Code Scanning is available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning).  


## Organisation Security Overview

At the organisation level, the [Security Overview](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/security/overview) provides a consolidated view of all reported security vulnerabilities across repositories. Using search filters, you can refine the view to show time-based data for specific repositories or teams.  

For example, this [filter](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/security/overview?query=archived%3Afalse+tool%3Agithub+repo%3Amodernisation-platform-environments+team%3Amodernisation-platform) displays vulnerability alerts in the `modernisation-platform-environments` repository for code owned by the `modernisation-platform` team.  

More details on using this feature can be found in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-overview/about-security-overview).
