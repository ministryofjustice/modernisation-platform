Whilst it is possible to see the results of a Terraform plan when you [create a pull request](./deploying-your-infrastructure.html#jobs-on-pull-request), it is also possible to run a Terraform plan locally.
Some engineers prefer this as it provides a quicker feedback loop to identify any issues with your infrastructure code.

## Enter your AWS SSO credentials

Get your AWS SSO credentials as detailed [here](./getting-aws-credentials.html), choose option 1 and paste the credentials into the terminal window you are working from.

>Please note that the credentials will expire after a period of 1 hour.

## Install Terraform

Follow the instructions [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) to install the latest version of Terraform according to your platform.

## Retrieve the Modernisation Platform account ID

You will need the Modernisation Platform account ID to assume the correct role when running `terraform init`.
You can retrieve the Modernisation Platform account ID from the SSM Parameter store via the web console, or via CLI.
This will allow you to assume the correct `role_arn`.

```
aws ssm get-parameters --region eu-west-2 \
--names "modernisation_platform_account_id" --with-decryption --query "Parameters[*].{Value:Value}" --output text
```

## Run Terraform plan

1. Navigate to your application infrastructure code - `cd modernisation-platform-environments/terraform/environments/my-application`
2. Run a Terraform init that assumes the backend role in the **Modernisation Platform** account - `terraform init -backend-config=assume_role={role_arn=\"arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/modernisation-account-terraform-state-member-access\"}`

> Remember to replace the `000000000000` placeholder with the Modernisation Platform account ID.

3. View the workspaces (you have different workspaces for your different environment accounts) - `terraform workspace list`
4. Select the required workspace - `terraform workspace select my-application-development`
5. Run a Terraform plan - `terraform plan`

>Running a plan locally has read only permissions, you will not be able to run an apply, destroy or import.
>The example syntax for assuming a backend role is appropriate for Terraform `1.6.0` onwards.
