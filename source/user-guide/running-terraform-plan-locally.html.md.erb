# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Whilst it is possible to see the results of a Terraform plan when you [create a pull request](./deploying-your-infrastructure.html#jobs-on-pull-request), it is also possible to run a Terraform plan locally.
Some engineers prefer this as it provides a quicker feedback loop to identify any issues with your infrastructure code.

## Enter your AWS SSO credentials

Get your AWS SSO credentials as detailed [here](./getting-aws-credentials.html), choose option 1 and paste the credentials into the terminal window you are working from.

>Please note that the credentials will expire after a period of 1 hour.

## Install Terraform

Follow the instructions [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) to install the latest version of Terraform according to your platform.

## Run Terraform plan

1. Navigate to your application infrastructure code - `cd modernisation-platform-environments/terraform/environments/my-application`
2. Run a Terraform init that assumes the backend role in the **Modernisation Platform** account- `terraform init -backend-config=assume_role={role_arn=\"arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/modernisation-account-terraform-state-member-access\"}`
>Please note that you will need to replace `000000000000` with the Modernisation Platform account ID.
3. View the workspaces (you have different workspaces for your different environment accounts) - `terraform workspace list`
4. Select the required workspace - `terraform workspace select my-application-development`
5. Run a Terraform plan - `terraform plan`

>Running a plan locally has read only permissions, you will not be able to run an apply, destroy or import.
