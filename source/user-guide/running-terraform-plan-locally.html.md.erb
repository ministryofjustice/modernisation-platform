# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Whilst it is possible to see the results of a Terraform plan when you [create a pull request](./deploying-your-infrastructure.html#jobs-on-pull-request), it is also possible to run a Terraform plan locally.
Some engineers prefer this as it provides a quicker feedback loop to identify any issues with your infrastructure code.

## Modify your providers.tf and secrets.tf

In the [modernisation-platform-environments repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments), in your application folder there are files called `providers.tf` and `secrets.tf`

These files detail the Terraform AWS providers used, which roles they use when running Terraform and details of the environments management secret.

The top part of each file details the configuration which is needed to run the Terraform on the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines. The second section, which is by default commented out, details configuration required if running a plan locally.


To run a plan locally, you need to comment out the top section of both the files, and uncomment the bottom section of the files.  Comments within the file show which sections.

>Note do not check in to GitHub any modifications to the file, as this will cause the pipeline to stop working, these changes are only for running Terraform plans locally.

## Enter your AWS SSO credentials

Get your AWS SSO credentials as detailed [here](./getting-aws-credentials.html), choose option 1 and paste the credentials into the terminal window you are working from.

>Please note that the credentials will expire after a period of 1 hour.

## Install Terraform

Follow the instructions [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) to install the latest version of Terraform according to your platform.

## Run Terraform plan

1. Navigate to your application infrastructure code - `cd modernisation-platform-environments/terraform/environments/my-application`
1. Run a Terraform init - `terraform init`
1. View the workspaces (you have different workspaces for your different environment accounts) - `terraform workspace list`
1. Select the required workspace - `terraform workspace select my-application-development`
1. Run a Terraform plan - `terraform plan`

>Running a plan locally has read only permissions, you will not be able to run an apply.
