## Patching for EC2 Instances

You can use the [modernisation-platform-terraform-ssm-patching](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-ssm-patching) module to create [AWS SSM Patch Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html) resources in your account.

The module creates an s3 bucket for log storage, as well as maintenance windows, tasks, resource groups, and patch baselines.

To use this module, you must have instances with the SSM agent installed (Comes as default with many AMIs), as well as have a tag of "Patching: Yes". Please be aware, if `patch_schedule` variable is not supplied, the default will power down instances at 10pm on a Monday. Please see the module for guidance on how to implement, and to raise any issues.
