You should refer to the MoJ Technical Guidance for [how to host services](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/documentation/standards/hosting.html#how-to-host-services).

By default, you must use the Cloud Platform unless you're advised otherwise by a member of the [Hosting team](https://peoplefinder.service.gov.uk/teams/hosting).

The Modernisation Platform is generally for applications that don't fit into the Cloud Platform, which tend to be legacy applications.

For your specific use-case, you should contact the [Hosting team](https://peoplefinder.service.gov.uk/teams/hosting) who can help advise what you should use.
