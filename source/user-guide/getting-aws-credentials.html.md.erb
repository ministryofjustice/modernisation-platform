# <%= current_page.data.title %>

You can obtain temporary AWS credentials to use the AWS CLI or other command line tools.

To have access to your AWS credentials you will need to be a member of the Github team specified when the [environment was created](./creating-environments.html#github-team-slug)


Note - you do not need to obtain AWS credentials to deploy infrastructure, this is done via Github Workflows (see [deploying you infrastructure](deploying-your-infrastructure.html).

If you need credentials to make an application deployment, a CI user is created as part of the initial account set up, see [here](obtaining-deployment-credentials.html) for obtaining the credentials for that user.


1. [Log in to the AWS Console](accessing-the-aws-console.html)

1. Select the account you wish to access programatically

1. Choose the `Command line or programmatic access` options

1. Follow the instructions on screen to retrieve your credentials.
