You can obtain temporary AWS credentials to use the AWS CLI or other command line tools. This is required as the use of long-lived access keys is not supported.

To have access to your AWS credentials you will need to be a member of the GitHub team specified when the [environment was created](./creating-environments.html#sso-group-name)

Note - you do not need to obtain AWS credentials to deploy infrastructure, this is done via GitHub Workflows (see [deploying your infrastructure](deploying-your-infrastructure.html)).

If you need credentials to make an application deployment, a CI user is created as part of the initial account set up, see [here](obtaining-deployment-credentials.html) for obtaining the credentials for that user.

1. If using the AWS CLI, follow the instructions set out in this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)

2. The following covers the steps to obtain short-lived access key & secret needed to connect to an account.

-  [Log in to the AWS Console](accessing-the-aws-console.html)

-  Select the account you wish to access programmatically

-  Against the role that you wish to use, select `Access Keys`. 

-  In the pop-up window, select the operating system tab that best matches the device you are using.

-  Under `Option 1`, copy the AWS Environment Variables using the copy feature to the right of the variables, then paste these into the terminal.

-  The AWS CLI options will now be available to use using the role and the correct profile set up in 1 above. For using the short-lived credentials with terraform, there is no requirement to set up the CLI profile.

- As these credentials are short-lived, it will be necessary to refresh them periodically. To do so, repeat the steps above & paste the new key variables into the terminal.

This AWS [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtogetcredentials.html) provides further information how to use the short-lived credentials from Identity Centre with the CLI.
