Before an application goes into production, the Modernisation Platform team will check that the following steps have been taken on the production account to ensure the high quality of infrastructure on the platform.

You can speed up these checks by preparing as much as possible in advance.

## Checklist

1. For public facing interfaces - [Create DDoS alarms, enable SRT access, enable Layer 7 Mitigation for ELBs](../runbooks/enabling-shield-advanced.html).
1. All EC2 instances have the AWS Systems Manage Session Manager [SSM Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html) installed.
1. Infrastructure code has been reviewed and signed off by a Modernisation Platform engineer.
1. The application runbook (`README.md`` in the application folder in the [modernisation-platform-environments repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/tree/main/terraform/environments)) has been completed.
1. The application conforms to the [MoJ Technical Guidance](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/) and [MoJ Security Guidance](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/)
1. The application has been tested.
1. The applications `go-live-date` date has been updated in the environments folder [here.](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/environments)

1. No sensitive data is made public.
1. Secrets are stored in Secrets Manager and rotation is enabled.
1. Security groups are locked down as much as possible.
1. The infrastructure is resilient and spread across availability zones.
1. 3rd party modules or code are not used.
1. The infrastructure is sensibly sized.
1. There is no attempt to escalate privileges or provide access to parties outside of the platform.
1. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
1. Code is dry and well written with no commented out blocks.
