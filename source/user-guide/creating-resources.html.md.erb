## Overview

Once your [environment](creating-environments.html) and [networking](creating-networking.html) have been created, now the fun begins and you can start building!

On environment creation, base [Terraform](https://terraform.io) resources are created for you in the [modernisation-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/) repository in the environments folder.

These resources are preconfigured with a backend, providers etc, all that you need to start adding in infrastructure such as EC2s or RDS databases.

## Creating new resources

 - Clone the [Modernisation Platform environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments) repository: `git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments.git`
 - Create a new Terraform files or resources in your application folder under `terraform/environments/`
 - We recommend following standard Terraform best practices, such as creating a `main.tf`, or logically named Terraform files, such as `database.tf` or `s3.tf`
 - Environment specific variables can be passed in through an [application_variables.json](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/templates/application_variables.json), defined as a [local](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/templates/locals.tf#L41) and [referenced accordingly](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/templates/locals.tf#L40)
 - Data lookups are provided for common things you may need from the platform such as subnets or DNS zones [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/templates/data.tf)

## GitHub Permissions
 - For any files created in your application folder, your GitHub team will have permissions to create and merge pull requests.
 - Your GitHub team will be assigned as a [codeowner](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-code-owners) for your application folder, so someone in your team will be required to review any pull requests before they can be merged.

## Restrictions
- The following files you will not be able to amend without an approving review from the Modernisation Platform team.
  - `providers.tf`
  - `backend.tf`
  - `subnet_share.tf`
  - `networking.auto.tfvars.json`

- The ability to create some resources will be restricted and will require assistance from the Modernisation Platform team.

## Next Steps
Once you have defined your infrastructure as code you can [deploy your infrastructure](deploying-your-infrastructure.html) to the Modernisation Platform.
