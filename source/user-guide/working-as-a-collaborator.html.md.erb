# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Once you have been [set up as a collaborator](../runbooks/adding-collaborators.html) you can -

* [Create infrastructure in the modernisation-platform-environments repository](creating-resources.html#creating-resources-in-the-modernisation-platform)
* [Deploy infrastrucutre via GitHub Actions workflows](deploying-your-infrastructure.html)
* [View your accounts via the AWS console](#logging-in-to-the-aws-console)
* [Use AWS credentials](#getting-access-credentials)
* [Run Terraform plans locally](#running-a-terraform-plan-locally-as-a-collaborator)
* [Access EC2s and databases](#accessing-ec2s-as-a-collaborator)

## Logging in to the AWS Console

1. Click on the AWS Console url - [https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/)

1. You will see the sign on screen, choose IAM user and enter the Modernisation Platform landing zone account number (this will be provided to you on set up).

1. Enter your user details (your MFA and console password must be [set up first](../runbooks/adding-collaborators.html#access-to-the-relevant-aws-accounts))

1. Once you are logged in, [switch role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html) to the relevant account.

1. You will need to know the account number of the AWS account you want to switch to and the role you have been assigned, these will be told to you on initial user set up, the valid roles are:

|Role|Description|Typical User|
|---|---|---|
|read-only|Read only console access|Used by read only users such as security testers|
|security-audit|AWS security-audit policy|Used by security testers|
|developer|Read only console plus other permissions such as the ability to set secrets,restart EC2s, raise support tickets.|Used by engineers working on the application infrastructure|
|sandbox|Admin role to perform most AWS actions via the console| Used by engineers to make development easier in some situations, only allowed in the development account

You can see the accounts and roles assigned to you [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/collaborators.json)

## Getting access credentials

AWS provides credentials which can give you programatic access to your AWS account. This enables you to run AWS CLI commandes or Terraform plans locally.

* [Getting AWS Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys)
* [Creating AWS profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html#cli-configure-profiles-create)

## Running a Terraform plan locally as a collaborator

To run a Terraform locally as a collaborator, you will need to get your AWS credentials, and use [AWS Vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) or a similar tool to run Terraform using MFA.

You should follow the standard [running terraform plan locally](../user-guide/running-terraform-plan-locally.html) instructions, ignoring the SSO section, running Terraform using AWS Vault and making one further code change:

Under the local plan section of the `providers.tf` file:

```
######################### Run Terraform Plan Locally Only ##################################
# To run a Terraform Plan locally, uncomment this bottom section of code and comment out the top section

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
}
```

Add in an assume role block for the main provider with the account number that local plan is for, for example:

```
######################### Run Terraform Plan Locally Only ##################################
# To run a Terraform Plan locally, uncomment this bottom section of code and comment out the top section

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::<my-account-number>:role/developer"
  }
}
```
As with all local plan changes, please do not add these changes to version control or the CI/CD GitHub workflows will stop running.

## Accessing EC2s as a Collaborator

You will need to have the `developer` access role in order to use SSM/Bastion.

1. Download the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
1. Ensure you have your [AWS credentials](#getting-access-credentials)
1. In your terminal enter `aws configure` to set up credentials and enter the key and access key created in the previous step.
1. Open `~/.aws/config` in a text editor and enter the following to create your AWS profile:

```
[profile <my-application-account-name>]
source_profile = default
role_arn:arn:aws:iam::<your application account number>:role/developer
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::<landing zone account number>:mfa/<your user name>
role_session_name=<my-application-account-name>
```

### Accessing EC2s with SSM Agent installed

Most modern AMIs will already have the SSM Agent installed. You can connect to these instances directly with Session Manager.

1. Start a basic Session Manager session

`aws ssm start-session --target i-12345bc --profile <my aws profile>`

### Accessing EC2s via a bastion

1. Create a bastion EC2 using the [bastion module](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-bastion-linux)
1. Create or share your public key and preferred username as detailed in the [bastion readme](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-bastion-linux#readme)
1. Open `~/.ssh/config` in a text editor and enter the following:

```
Host bastion
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa #local path to the public key provided in earlier
     User <your user name>
     ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session --target $(aws ec2 describe-instances --no-cli-pager --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=bastion_linux" --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].InstanceId' --profile <my aws profile>) --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p' --profile <my aws profile> --region eu-west-2"
```

1. To SSH or other port tunneling (eg to connect to a database) through the bastion to your EC2 instance, using the relevant ports:

```
  ssh -L 33389:<IP address of destination instance>:3389 bastion
```

### Useful Tips

AWS Vault is a useful tool, and can be found [here.](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) It can easily be installed via brew on mac, and may help.
