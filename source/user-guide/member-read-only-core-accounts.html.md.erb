## Overview

To view core account resources (that is resources created in a core account and shared to member accounts) developers can switch to Read-only roles to view their created resources.

## Switching Roles

1) Log in (to your member account) the AWS Console using SSO. Click the drop down menu at the top right and choose `Switch Role`.

2) To view VPCs and lower level DNS resources (eg `hmpps-development.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk`) use the `member-delegation-read-only` role and use the account aliases for each Core VPC account:

`core-vpc-development`
`core-vpc-test`
`core-vpc-preproduction`
`core-vpc-production`

3) To view higher level DNS resources (eg. `modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk`), or to view Network Firewall resources (eg. CloudWatch logs or Network Firewall policies) use the `read-log-records` role and use the account alias for the Core Network account:

`core-network-services-production`

4) To view Shared Services resources i.e AMIs created and shared, use the `member-shared-services` role and use the account alias for the Shared Services account:

`core-shared-services-production`
