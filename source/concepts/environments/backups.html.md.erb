We use [AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/) to automatically back up production resources accross all the Modernisation Platform environments.

## What is backed up?

AWS Backup supports most common AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, EBS and EFS volumes, RDS and DynamoDB databases.

For a full list of resources please see here - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html

Please note that some resources may need extra configuration and new services may require an additional opt in.  Please refer to the AWS documentation and if you have any questions please ask the [Modernisation Platform team](../../getting-help).

Any of the above resources which are have the tag - `is-production = true` will be backed up.

## Backup Schedule

Backups are taken daily at 00:30.

## Retention period

Backups are retained for 4 months.  After one month they will be transferred to cold storage.

## How to find your backups

You can view your backups my navigating to AWS Backup in the AWS console and clicking "Backup vaults".

You can also view backups via the normal methods for viewing snapshots and AMIs (eg. EC2, Elastic Block Store, Snapshots)
