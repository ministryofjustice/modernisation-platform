We use [AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/) to automatically back up production resources across all the Modernisation Platform environments.

AWS Backup supports most common AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, EBS and EFS volumes, RDS and DynamoDB databases.

For a full list of supported resources please see here - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html

Please note that some resources may need extra configuration and new services may require an additional opt in.  Please refer to the AWS documentation and if you have any questions please ask the [Modernisation Platform team](../../getting-help).

You can also view backups via the normal methods for viewing snapshots and AMIs (eg. EC2, Elastic Block Store, Snapshots).
