> This document should be read in conjunction with the [MOJ Security Logging Guidance](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/logging-and-monitoring/#maximum-retention-period)

As part of our offering in the Modernisation Platform, we secure all environments (AWS accounts) to mitigate risk and protect teams from common security concerns.

## Retention period

Logs *should not* be retained for longer than 2 years without specific approval from the MoJ CISO. However, aggregate data from logging systems, such as the number of particular types of events or the total numbers of visits to sites, can be retained indefinitely, so long as care is taken to remove potentially unique or personally identifying information from the retained information set.

## External Logs

Logs for all services that can be accessed from the public Web should be kept for a minimum of 90 days.

## Internal Logs

Logs for all services that are accessed using an MoJ or Government identity or login should be kept for a minimum of 13 months.

## Variations

These requirements are defined and required by legislation, regulation such as the Law Enforcement Directive, or certification compliance such as [PCI-DSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard). Variations or exceptions should not be created without the specific documented permission of the MoJ CISO
