> This document should be read in conjunction with the [MOJ Security Logging Guidance](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/logging-and-monitoring/#maximum-retention-period)

As part of our offering in the Modernisation Platform, we secure all environments (AWS accounts) to mitigate risk and protect teams from common security concerns.

## Retention period

Logs *should not* be retained for longer than 2 years without specific approval from the MoJ CISO. However, aggregate data from logging systems, such as the number of particular types of events or the total numbers of visits to sites, can be retained indefinitely, so long as care is taken to remove potentially unique or personally identifying information from the retained information set.
