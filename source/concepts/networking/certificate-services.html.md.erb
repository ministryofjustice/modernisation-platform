## Public Certificates

Public certificates are typically created in the member/application account that uses them. For example, if your application runs behind an `aws_lb_listener` in the preproduction environment and you need to configure a `certificate_arn`, you will create the certificate in the preproduction account.

The domain `modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk` is managed by the modernisation-platform team. All environments under this domain, such as `my-application.nomis.hmpps-test.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk` can create their own public certificates using [AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html). For information on DNS naming conventions refer to [DNS naming](dns.html#dns).

On the other hand, the following domains are managed by the operations-engineering team (`#ask-operations-engineering`)

- justice.gov.uk
- service.justice.gov.uk

To request a public certificate under either of the above domains, refer to [Requesting a new certificate via Gandi.net](https://operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/services/SSL-certificate-management.html#requesting-a-new-certificate-via-gandi-net). Once you receive the public certificate, you can then import it into your environment by following the instructions in [Getting certificates ready in AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains-prerequisites.html). For more concrete low-level instructions on the latter refer to [How to import public certificate into AWS Certificate Manager](../../user-guide/certificate-import.html)

## Private Certificates

We provide a [Private root Certificate Authority (CA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html) in the [network services account and VPC](networking-approach.html#other-vpcs), along with subordinate production and non production CAs.

The subordinate CA's are then shared to the application environments via a [RAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html) share (either production or non production depending on the environment).

Certificates can then be created using the Private subordinate CA, the certificates remain local to the application environment.
