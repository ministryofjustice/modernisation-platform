## Public Certificates

There are two main ways to use public certificates for DNS on the Modernisation Platform; ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager) public certificates, and Gandi.net certificates imported into ACM.
Please see [How to configure DNS for public services](../../user-guide/how-to-configure-dns.html) for more information.

## Private Certificates

We provide a [Private root Certificate Authority (CA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html) in the [network services account and VPC](networking-approach.html#other-vpcs), along with subordinate production and non production CAs.

The subordinate CA's are then shared to the application environments via a [RAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html) share (either production or non production depending on the environment).

Certificates can then be created using the Private subordinate CA, the certificates remain local to the application environment.
