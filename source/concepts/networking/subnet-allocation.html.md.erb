When we set up a VPC for an environment (AWS account) we provide subnets for transit gateway connection, protected reources such as VPC endpoints, along with a general subnet set.
See the [subnets](./networking-approach.html#subnets) section for more information.

Here we go into a bit more detail on how the [CIDR ranges](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/cidr-allocation.md) have been created and how they are allocated.

## How have we decided the ranges?

Research was done on the existing MoJ network infrastructure to ensure that we didn't clash with any existing ranges.
The modernisation platform [CIDR ranges](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/cidr-allocation.md) are documented here.  By predefining IP ranges it makes it easier for us to onboard new applications.

## Example

Below is an example of how CIDR ranges would be assigned. In this example there are 2 additional subnet sets for this VPC, but normally we would expect the general set to be enough for a business area.
