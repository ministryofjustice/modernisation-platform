The Modernisation Platform hosts much of the MoJs legacy infrastructure, like any software, this needs patching and updates to ensure the software stays secure.

## Patching Policy

The Modernisation Platform team are responsible for the patching and updating of the core platform infrastructure and any tools or pipelines that we provide.
Please see [Our Offer](../../user-guide/our-offer-to-you.html) for details on our shared responsibility model.

We expect application teams to keep their infrastructure and application patched and up-to-date.

If we discover a high risk vulnerability and are unable to contact the application team, we reserve the right to apply patching, updates or take the application offline if we feel the platform or MoJ are at risk.
