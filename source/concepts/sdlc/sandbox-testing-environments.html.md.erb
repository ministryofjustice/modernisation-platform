This is a list of non core or member environments.  These environments are used for core platform development and testing work.

Please note this does not include member development accounts which are given [sandbox access](../../user-guide/creating-environments.html#sandbox) to enable rapid development.

## Environments

| Name | AWS Account Name | Terraform Location | Usage | How to run Terraform |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Core Sandbox | shared-services-dev |[core-sandbox](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/environments/core-sandbox)| Development or prototyping work that requires a completely disconnected account. | This account does not have secure baselines or a Github actions workflow.  Terraform must be run locally.|
| Core VPC Sandbox | core-vpc-sandbox |[core-vpc](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/environments/core-vpc) | Development work for the core-vpc.  This account is associated with the core-vpc-sandbox workspace and is idential to the other core-vpc accounts, except that only sprinkler-develoment and cooker-development use the networking provided. | There is no Github action, Terraform must be run locally.
| Testing Test | testing-test | [testing](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/environments/testing)| Exact copy of a member account in terms of networking and baselines, but empty. Used for running Terratests in. | Github action for the networking configuration, but only Terraform run as part of tests should be used here. |
| Sprinkler Development | sprinkler-development | [sprinkler](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/tree/main/terraform/environments/sprinkler) | Like a member account but uses core-vpc-sandbox networking. Used to create and test infrastructure.| Github action in the environments repository. |
| Cooker Development | cooker-development | [cooker](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/tree/main/terraform/environments/cooker) | Like a member account but uses core-vpc-sandbox networking. Used to create and test infrastructure.| Github action in the environments repository. |
| Example | example-development | [example](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/tree/main/terraform/environments/example) | Example code to show users how to create simple infrastructure. Infrastructure should only be created here to test that the example code is valid, then destroyed. | Github action in the environments repository
